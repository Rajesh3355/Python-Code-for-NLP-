I honestly don't care about a restaurant's decor generally but one thing that does irritate me about a place is when, no matter what direction you are sitting, you're facing a tv. That paired with the very loud volume made it a little difficult for discussion but that's my only complaint. We ordered the grilled zucchini as an appetizer and although it took longer than expected, was definitely worth the wait. The balsamic glaze was all I could have hoped for and more, and it paired perfectly with the slightly charred taste of the zucchini. Can I also please say it's SO nice to see an appetizer that's not deep fried! For my meal I had the Nekkid Burgher which is basically a burger on a bed of field greens with slices of mozzarella and tomato and my beloved balsamic glaze. It was a little more of a salad than a burger, but that's not a complaint from me. I was pretty pleased although there was a little but too much glaze added for my taste even though it was delicious. My date got a more traditional looking burger with a bunch of toppings and sauces that he said he fully enjoyed.

My friend and I decided that we would just get the food to go, so it wasn't such a big deal if the dining area wasn't in great shape. Unfortunately, later on we both ended up getting stomachaches from the food that we ordered. I don't really have a lot of confidence in this restaurant at this point. If you go for a meal, be aware that the state of the place is certainly far from clean.

Timing was perfect between courses and the meals were very well done. She got the twin lobster tails with asparagus and rice pilaf and I got the prime rib with a baked potato. The tails were perfect and the rice pilaf was a bit different, but very fresh and not overly salty. My prime rib was a bit on the rare side, which I usually order medium rare, and a bit unevenly cooked. But the flavor and crust were phenomenal so that evened out to me. Every bite melted in your mouth. Never even used the au jus or horseradish sauce (which was a bit too bland for me, then again I used to grow my own!).

I was kind of underwhelmed. The parking lot is a disaster. It needs resurfaced and it's hard to navigate. The waiting area is tiny and congested. The patrons are suburban families looking to feed their families and I noticed large parties. You got your atypical chips and salsa. We had a good (no, actually, she was great) waitress that was very attentive to our needs. I had just gotten off work and devoured chips--she brough back salsa and chips. They were just okay. Too many broken pieces of chips in the basket which makes it hard to scoop the salsa. It was not bland. I split a steak and chicken fajita meal with my father--it was sized for two to share and I was impressed with the serving. It was good, but it did not come out sizzling. I was a little disappointed with that. They give three tortillas (not house made) which... was kind of disappointing. If you want to take leftovers home, you can't really re-make without tortillas... I guess you can ask for more but it just didn't make sense. I also had a tamale on the side. It was just okay... The masa was really good on the one side of the tamale--soft, flavorful, shredded chicken inside. The other side was dry. It was almost as if they didn't roll the tamale correctly before they steamed it. Honestly, if they could have executed this correctly, it would have made my visit because everything else was... not that exceptional. Since I have to write something positive each time I want to say that our waitress was phenominal. She was so attentive to everything from the aforementioned chips, to drink refills, to telling me that the fajitas came with guacamole (I had asked for a side of it not paying attention to the menu that it was included). I really appreciated that. Our table didn't have hot sauce on it (how can the busser miss that?) and she brought me her recommended kind. I will not return, I was not impressed.",0,0,0,Negative

None of us got the dessert so I can't comment. Now, for my word of caution. We were having a good time and I wasn't paying attention. I ordered a Blanton's Manhattan up. It was tasty. It was about an average pour in terms of size. In terms of quality I would put it at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. What is amazing is its price tag of $16. I don't think I was charged $16 in Manhattan for a Manhattan. Unfortunately, I ordered 2 and $32 later, I had racked up a bit of a bar tab. I can just hear what you're saying: ""Caveat emptor."" And you're right. So, to be fair, the restaurant is slightly below average in interior design in terms of what you would expect for the quality of meal that they serve. This is not the interior of 11, for instance or Umi. To compare, you will pay about the same. But the wait staff couldn't be better. The food couldn't be better. Just watch out for the price of the drinks! Perhaps consider stopping at one!",1,1,1,Positive

On the day I went in, it was incredibly busy which was a good sign for it. I really didn't want a big meal, so I took one of the outside bar seats. I was promptly waited on by the server - and then a second server came and was rather upset that someone else had ""stolen"" their table. Really, not my problem. I didn't want anything more than a snack so I found the menu a little problematic that way - I wanted to find some little nibbles, not a plate of sliders. So I opted for an order of Lola fries. They were piping hot little shoestring fries dusted with a little rosemary. They were served upright in a small metal cup which meant that eating them was messy - there was no plate with them. They were okay, nothing fantastic. I did have the chance to try the Lola ketchup (vinegary - meh, nothing like a ketchup). The Coffee bbq was okay, again, nothing that knocked my socks off. I don't drink so I asked for an iced tea. My biggest peeve on iced tea is that it is weak so that when you add ice, it is nothing more than colored water. And, unfortunately, that was the case here. Doubt me on that? Well.... the huffy server thought I was drinking water and couldn't tell it was tea when it was refill time. How sad is that. The service leaves a lot to be desired. The wait service didn't get any better. Maybe b\/c I was alone or not a big bill, the service was not great. I was there an hour - and I got a refill 45 minutes into my stay. The hostess was at the main entrance playing with her cell phone. This is the first person that sets the stage for the rest of the meal. Sad. All in all, it was not worth the wait. Mildly disappointing. I might be tempted to try it again next trip to see if the meals are any better - perhaps he might have employed his co-worker Bobby Flay to come in and help him pre-opening to get the staff ready for their debut and teach them how to brew iced tea :)",1,0,0,Negative

So I wanted to give this restaurant a try. The menu was interesting and small for breakfast so the choices weren't hard to make at all. Our waitress asked me what type of egg I wanted since it was ""any style"" so I asked for poached. She immediately said "" we don't do poached."" So maybe that should be specified a little better. The service was terrible, after our waitress first rushed us through our order - never once asked us how our meal was - not once asked us if we wanted a refill for our $3 a piece free refill drinks and just threw the bill on our table never asking us if our order was complete. One of the most horrible servers I can ever remember having. The food was good though, aside from my spoonful amount of home fries and lack of enough butter and jam to get even on half one side of my English muffin. Extremely pricey breakfast for the amount. My fiancé got eggs with biscuits and gravy - you'd think there'd be sausage like normal biscuits and gravy - not here. I liked the ambience of the restaurant - the decor was unusual and modern and interesting - but the chairs weren't comfortable - hard wood. I would eat here again to give it another try because it wasn't the food that was bad- but make sure I get a different waitress because I didn't see any other server that day be as rude as ours was.

I opted for the Italian Wedding soup as my introductory offerings. Armstrongs hits a home run with their soup. It was a very large bowl, which was a pleasant surprise, but the taste was outstanding and might be the best I've ever had. It was loaded with white meat chicken, small meatballs, pasta, escarole, and a delicious broth. Coming from a very Italian area outside Providence, RI, I was literally in shock. Unfortunately, it went down hill from there. I soooo wanted to give this a 4\/5 star rating. My food came out fast -- almost too fast. The portion size was enormous. However, food is clearly about quality not quantity. The veal and breading (while crisp) were both unseasoned. Note I didn't say under seasoned, I said unseasoned. The type that would make Robert Irvine throw the dish on the floor. It was completely tasteless and an absolute travesty to the poor calf that died for this meal. Next I tackled the portion that had sauce and cheese, hoping for a save. Their sauce is an insult to every Italian grandmother in the world. This watery red mess had NO seasoning whatsoever (which should be evident by bits of color from basil, oregano, etc...) It tasted like a mass produced variant of Chef Boyardee's sauce. Gross. The same sauce was drenched all over my linguine, so you know how I feel there. The service was great and soup was excellent, so hopefully I'll give it another try for scrod, open faced roast beef, or something else. For now, I recommend you try another Coraoplis local for Italian offerings.",5,1,0,Negative

When I went there a few months ago, I ordered a burger. It's about $5-6 dollars, with no sides included, and they up charge for EVERYTHING. Cheese is $1 (which is understandable), but even lettuce and tomato were an additional 25 cents each, and plain raw onions were an additional 75 cents. They didn't inform me about the lettuce and tomato charges, and I only saw it after getting my check at the end of the meal (onions were mentioned on the menu, but it's still ridiculous to charge for that). The person I was with got an omelet and asked for Italian bread, and they charged him an additional 20 cents (once again, we were never informed about this, just saw it on the check). I ordered a side of fries and they are unseasoned, plain frozen French fries you'd find in the grocery store. I was given about 10-15 total. But the worst part about this all was that they gave me this hamburger on a stale, old bun. I couldn't even bite into it. I was so disgusted I can't ever go back there.

We've been saying for years that we were in need of some good, local choices. Then to find out it was going to be Thai...we were just super thrilled!

I'm sure once they work out the kinks, they'll be just fine. But the food is pretty darn great! We haven't disliked anything we've tried so far. Don't hesitate to try as much of the Curry dishes as possible. The green curry (or Keaw Wan) and the Pumpkin Curry were SUPER and we're looking forward to trying the Yellow Curry next. We also had the Kanom Jeen Nam Ngiao, which is a curry with pork, tomatoes and rice noodles, pickled mustard greens, bean sprouts and fresh lime, the Spring Rolls and the Pork Moo Yang appetizers, and finally, the Beef Pad Kra Prow, with green beans and peppers sauteed in a dark basil sauce, topped with a fried egg, served with jasmine rice.

Maybe their curry is out of this world? Maybe sweet pad Thai is like the most authentic pad Thai there is, and all these other haters have been making theirs wrong. I don't know. I'm not Thai. It was good, but not...what I expected (wanted). They put together some fun decor on the inside, but it's pretty small. As I looked through the other reviews I saw pictures that looked completely different than what I saw...is there a back room or something? The outside was a little messy. A couple was outside dining when I picked up my food. It was pretty much the first nice day of the spring, and maybe they just haven't cleaned up the front of the place...unless green plastic ""Little Tikes"" turtle sandboxes leaning against the side of the building are some sort of Thai decor about which I'm ignorant.

I would rate this location 4.5 on its way to five stars with very high quality food and service. We were greeted warmly by the host staff and service staff, and the manager (Jason) stopped by to introduce himself. The table service was excellent, as was the pizza (Margarita)and pasta dish(Cappelletti) we tried. Not to skip on dessert, we ordered Tiramisu and the Delizia Al Limone. One to try and one to take home for later. Both were excellent, but the Tiramisu was the best I've ever had and would recommend above all else. We will definitely return and recommend this location. Now the details if you wish to read further. The pizza is cooked in traditional Neapolitan style (thin crust, wood fired oven, cooked for 90 seconds) and the filled pasta is made from scratch each morning in their 'dough' room. The owners and staff take pride in the quality of the product and love to share it with guests, which is why the dough room faces to the outside of the building with a window to the sidewalk and anyone who drives or walks by can view the process. There are no secrets to putting out great food. You make it from scratch with quality ingredients and a lot of labor. So why not five stars? The pizza was served with the dough on the soggy side which took away from the overall meal. This is the hardest to get right when doing Neapolitan pizza, as the dough is only 3 millimeters thick. But I've traveled a bit and I've experienced the holy grail of thin -but not soggy- Neapolitan pizza, and it is usually served on a corrugated platter or wood peel to prevent the condensation which immediately occurs when placing the pie to a tin serving plate. I have no doubt that if the management is reading this, they will start experimenting with wood platters to try and get it right. I read through some previous comments (high prices, no kids menu, no unsolicited refills on water, service inconsistencies) and found them mainly to be true. But service inconsistencies can happen in any restaurant, and if you experience an issue, you should allow the staff and management an opportunity to make it right. (Our party ordered drinks with our meal, so no water refills needed. And as an aside, our reservation was delayed by another party setting up camp at their table - I can't blame the establishment for someone else being inconsiderate - to put it nicely.)But anyone who travels here should realize this is not a pizza joint. It's fine dining. If you search Yelp for 'pizza' and find this listed along with Pizza Outlet and Fox's, one should realize they are not the same. If you're thinking the price is high because 'it's just pizza', then you're thinking must also follow that real Ramen is just dried noodles with a seasoning packet thrown in. It's a premium product and their prices reflect accordingly. Personal preference on ambiance aside, the décor is beautiful with a lot of attention to detail with an ornate carved wood-paneled ceiling, fixtures and tapestries which complement the space, and an open view of the pizza oven which you can watch the pizza maker in action if you are lucky enough to sit in view. The outside offers an outdoor fireplace, and I'd love to come back and enjoy the outdoor space in the warmer months. After our meal one of the owners also made the rounds and stopped by to introduce himself and check on our dinners. I can say we were so impressed by our experience on our first visit, my wife joked on how we could find a way to come back the next night. Jason overheard us and joked as well that it would be such a surprise, and so I took it as a bit of a personal challenge. So I did one better and we came back the next evening and we brought four friends who had never visited! All of us enjoyed the food along with great service.",0,0,1,Positive

Once I finally gave in and tried it...well, I'm hooked. It's like crack on crust. I've since had some wannabe 'buff chick' pizzas but they just can't compete. I will add 2 downsides to the place. Their prices are a bit unreasonably high. Only a mile from the house, we usually just go to pick it up. Even then, with an order of Frankie Bites or some fries, it's in the $25+ range. I can go to my all-time fave pizza joint a couple of miles out the road and get a larger pepperoni and sausage pizza for half the price. Their delivery range is curious, at best. My girlfriend works 1 mile from the place but they won't deliver to her business. This costs them at least 1-2 orders per week, just from her! More curious is that I've mentioned it to the guy who runs the place. He says they should be delivering there but when my gal called the other day, a so-called assistant manager said NO. My gal said it sounded more like one of the teenagers who works there. All said, great food. Prices a little steep. Questionable delivery. Would I recommend the place? Yes!

Everything about them is comfort- creamy crab, sweet corn, fried coating, and very delicious, creamy dipping sauce. The presentation was very nice ad well.

The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone. I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard. Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha! 4. Food came. My burger had lettuce on it only. Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks. I had to wait to ask for my pickle. 5. The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting. Disappointment. 6. The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check. Never again will I eat at Friday's. I will, however, go should a happy hour arise...",0,1,0,Negative

The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks. Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died. Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.",2,0,0,Negative

It's lent, and in Pittsburgh that means long lines for fish sandwiches, so I figured it'd be quick, and since I'm almost certainly going to burn in hell anyway...why not eat meat? It was quick, so at the very least I'm half right. I ordered the ""Zeus"" off the ""specialty"" menu and got my gyro in about 5 minutes. It was slightly too big to carry in the little brown paper bag they give you so I had to cradle it like a newborn on the way to the car. After I unwrapped it back in my office I thought maybe they'd forgotten the pita...because I couldn't see it. The Zeus is Chris Farley's proverbial ""Fat Guy in a Little Coat""...it was messy and there was so much stuff inside the pita that the pita itself couldn't be found. Once I did find it, I spent probably three minutes trying to figure out the best way to hold it without it turning into a complete nightmare. (There is no best way). Tasted great. I loved it. But okay, seriously...Greeks, it's okay to make a pita slightly larger so that you can accommodate more stuff. Pitas do NOT have to be one size fits all. Or wait...do they? Is that one of those weird ethnic rules that a REAL pita will only measure 1\/2 cubit in diameter or something? I don't think that's a thing. Is that a thing?

They really have something going right here with the food, but just putting on some music and getting an extra server would greatly improve the dining experience. Also, you can order food to-go (which we attempted to do for our first dining experience) but they won't tell you what's in a roll on the phone when ordering because people 'steal' his recipes.

The lady that sat us immediately asked us if we were using a coupon which I had no knowledge of. This is where I think the brunt of her stand-offishness and passive aggressiveness came from. My girlfriend and I are both young and she must have thought it wasn't worth her time to serve us. Our only explanation is kids are going in with a coupon and not tipping well. Who knows? I tip well and am very pleasant at restaurants. I ordered a coke and it was only refilled once. She must have thought I had enough soda because she ignored the empty glass and instead chose to refill my tiny water glass one time. If she's worried about my health she should probably make sure my ounce of water is replenished more than once during the whole meal. I ordered the spaghetti and meatball and received just spaghetti and sauce. She slammed the plates down and ran away not refilling our empty glasses of water which we put at the edge of the table for her to see. When she finally came back to give us our bill (didn't give us a chance to inquire about dessert) I told her I didn't receive a meatball. She said I should have told her... when? She acted REALLY passive aggressive to my girlfriend for some unknown reason. When she asked for a box for the rest of her fettuccine alfredo she kind of tossed it at her while in full stride to another table. It fell right into her food. It was at this moment that I almost strangled someone for the first time in my life. The mental image you're creating from my description is completely accurate. I'm not trying to exaggerate it to get my point across. While quickly walking by she tossed a Styrofoam box at her food letting it fall into it. She didn't say a word or even look at us. It was the rudest thing someone's ever done to me. Seriously, the entire meal was awkward and there was for the most part 2 tables occupied the entire time.

This was a nice gesture, but we didn't come for free drinks. We got the boneless buffalo bites as an app. Pretty tasty. Two of us got onion soup, and two of us got a beef stew. When the soups came out, she warned us they were exremely hot. My stew was barely warm. Felt like it had been pulled out of a fridge and microwaved for 20 seconds on low heat. The onion soups were very very hot, but the flavor was pretty meh. As a main course, I went with the small plate crab cakes. They were well-seared, but they were very mushy inside. Probably a pretty low quality meat mixed with a bunch of filler. The sauce on top was the only saving grace. My wife got the chicken salad, and took about two bites. It was served with some pretty sad looking pink mushy out of season tomatoes. My friend got the beef stew pot pie thing, and they didn't even bring a spoon. It was basically a soup with a crust on top. Finally, I need to talk about the ridiculous prices here. $4.75 for a Yuengling? Come on. You can imagine how much the imports cost.

Two out of Six times I have gotten a bad pie to the point where I though I was going to chip a tooth on the crust. Anyone who ever worked in a pizza place can tell when dough is not fresh or over proofed. Sometimes it dries out on top and creates a pudding skin type effect on the raw dough. They roll it out anyway and think that by putting the hard pieces on bottom that it will change when cooked. It does change to the point of having little oyster cracker shaped hard bits all over the bottom of your pie. One time they were as hard as pieces of eggshell. In my opinion this is not satisfactory when you are play 12 plus dollars for some bread and cheese. The last one I got had an over proofed crust made out of old dough and did not taste anything like what it normally does. I will give it another try but I hope someone who works there reads this and makes some changes and addresses these problems.

However, there's that part about it being small and cramped that kind of goes a long with that. And again, they do allow smoking so be aware of that if you're sensitive to smoke. Because it is so small and there are so many people, it can get over whelming. Also, almost every employee working was seen smoking, including the kitchen staff. Now, they smoked in the dining room before they'd walk back to the kitchen.. but yikes. If the smell didn't bother me, that sort of did...... Truthfully, there's not much to say. I thought the food was good, so if that's your priority I'd say give it try.

The food here is superb, sushi is great and in a great size. Great decor inside. Comfortable waiting seats. The timing is not long, it's just about right. The hibachi is a unique experience from other places I've been. From my experience, the chef will interact more with people like tossing food to aim at your mouth, or squirting sake out of a toy child's mouth. If you're shy, it may feel uncomfortable cause they try to really include everybody at the table. Very unique. However, my only negative concerns is that the front staff occasionally doesn't understand English well, which is fine, but due to misunderstandings , has messed up our orders a few times. They do promptly understand however and will give you what you correctly ask for which is great service. Also I don't like that you have to be placed with other strangers at a table.

The only reason I mention that is because, as someone who ISN'T a regular, walking in to that can be intimidating. You walk in, not sure of where you're even going, and everyone just stops and stares at you. Honestly, that's basically where the uncomfort ended. They don't mean any harm, it just is what it is. We mentioned to the bar tender that we were wanting to get lunch but the dining room doors were locked, and she apologized and took us to the dining room instead (apparently the dining room opens at 12, and they hadn't unlocked the doors yet - no big deal). The bar is a smoking area, so if that bothers you, beware. The dining room, however, is non-smoking. It's a very small area, with 3 booths and maybe 6 tables that seat 4 each. The decor is kind of outdated and is a nautical theme (..?), and the music matches the not-recently-updated atmosphere. As long as all of that doesnt matter to you, this place is pretty good! It's your typical little local, ""caters mostly to regulars"" establishment (or so it seems, anyway), but truthefully, the food is good and the people are friendly. I tried their ""Award Winning"" fish sandwich, and it was a good fish sandwich, but for the price, I think I'd opt to go elsewhere for something so readily available just about anywhere. They offer it in 3 different sizes - Small, Medium, & X-Large - all for different prices, and it comes totally plain and with no sides. You can add a side for $3, and then every topping you add is .50. So by the time I had it the way I wanted, I was paying around $13 for a fish sandwich at lunch time, when I could have had the same thing (or better) elsewhere for cheaper. I'm not saying not to try it, but I may be saying to try something else.. We did order the ""Bang Bang Shrimp"" to start with, and those were legit! It's not a big portion, but they were so good! My husband ordered the steak sub which he seemed to enjoy - it looked pretty good to me! Anyway, the service was prompt and friendly, and the prices, while I wouldn't say were great, weren't too bad.

Basically just bagged chips, not the warm and fresh fried ones you get at authentic mexican restaurants. The salsa tasted like stewed tomatoes. I'm on a diet so I opted for a salad instead of my usual burrito. Stick to the main entrees, the salad wasn't that impressive. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their orders though. I think if i would have skipped the chips and just went with the standard Mad Mex burrito I would have been happier. Probably the worst part of our meal was my fiance's Margarita.

If getting off the beaten path is not enough of an excuse for you, let me be the eleventh to tell you how great the food is: Udipi serves some of the best cuisine I've ever had the pleasure to taste. The samosas are near perfect and served with hari (green) and meethhi (tamarind) chutneys that must be blessed by Annapurna, as I can offer no other explanation as to why they were so much better than your typical Indian condiment offerings. Aloo Gobi and Baingan Bartha are two of my favorite dishes and though it is hard for me to stray, I am eager to try other things on the menu. I believe that Udipi takes great care in preparing food, as if it all should be fit for prasada . Eat like a deva but accept your fate of eternal samsara, as the kama of dining at Udipi will keep you coming back for more.

I haven't tried the veggie sausage, I think it might have egg in it (example of how a menu indication could be useful). Beet balls = yum! Garbanzo fries, also a hit! Some of the cocktails are way overpriced. The ""Refugio"" is a nice enough mezcal drink, but it's $14 and not up to par with Salt or Cantina's less pricey concoctions. It was not particularly strong, like a mezcal drink should be; it was rather on the sweet side and was lacking the bitter and sour elements of the grapefruit ingredient. Plus, it is served in a coupe with a plastic straw, which seems tacky and pointless (the straw).

The service was equally remarkable. The menu was eclectic yet varied sufficiently that all members of our group found something of interest. The food combinations that we had were well prepared and quite delicious. There really is nothing negative to say about the meal whatsoever. The issues that I have with this restaurant have to do with the cognitive dissonance of dining in an upscale hot dog restaurant. I just could not get past the fact that I was paying $15 for what amounts to a dog, fries and a beer. I can see bringing people here for the upscale atmosphere, but I think I would be otherwise uncomfortable treating someone to a meal as simple as a frankfurter, if it were that special of an occasion.

That honor goes to Tessaro's, and I've never been anywhere that comes close. It's not the second best burger in Pittbsurgh, which is probably Burgatory. It would be a tough argument to make for number three, but I think it deserves consideration in the top five and easily beats out many of the places I have heard mentioned as having top five burgers like BRGR and Eleven. The burgers are juicy and almost creamy. They do a pretty good job, which most places don't, of actually giving me a real rare burger. The topping are phenominal: great selection of high quality cheeses, great bacon and sauteed mushrooms and onions. The bun is also good. They also have fresh cut fries, which they do very well. This is very important, since many places (BRGR for instnace) will hurt a good burger with fries that aren't fresh cut. Also, if you are carb or health conscious, you can get your burger with a side salad, which I've done before. Their salads are nothing special, but they use good field greens with a nice balsamic vinagrette. The salad was only greens, which I thought was a fine complement to the burger. I really like the Industry Public House Copper Ale, which they presumably brew themselves. At $4 it's a fair price for a good craft beer. I like the atmosphere, but the chairs are defenitely a little uncomfortable--Henry Clay Frick would not have been happy with having to sit on them.

Industry sort of has this Jekyll and Hyde persona. On weekdays and nights it is sort of low key, not too crowded, with people sitting at tables quietly eating dinner and some guests at the bar watching whatever game is on one of their 20 or so TVs. But on the weekend its an entirely different story. Industry is sort of following the trend of what I like to call the Butler Street weekend; tons of young drunks flocking in to the neighborhood from the universities and other nearby neighborhoods looking for places to party. On the weekends places like Industry pack them in and keep the party going. That being said, my fiance and I prefer the former, but understand the Industry's need for the latter. The food here is really good. Think bar food themes, but amped up with top notch ingredients. You can't go wrong with the Mac and Cheese, Pot Roast, and most of the sandwiches are top notch. The only entree that I have been slightly disappointed with has been the IPA battered fish sandwich which was slightly too salty. On the bar side of things the beer list is top notch with lots of local brewery selections and the whiskey list is one of the better ones I've seen in the city. The only issue that keeps Industry from getting 5 stars is the service always seems to be so-so. Nobody ever seems too excited to take your order and the waitstaff isn't always prepared to answer questions about the menu. Some of the bartenders are very personable while others not so much.

As I was alone, I grabbed a seat at the bar thinking I'd just get a quick drink and dessert then head back to my AirBnB. I ended up hanging out for about 3 hours. People at the bar were super friendly and I got to watch the waitstaff slice charcuterie - which looked amazing. Also, one of the awesome bartenders, upon finding out I was new to town, gave me a list of food suggestions and fun things to do while in Pittsburgh. Cocktails were interesting and their sangria was perfect for an unusually hot spring day. For dessert, I ordered the churros which came with a chocolate hazlenut sauce - YUMMMMMMM.

Think the Spanish version of Cure. Great variety in terms of cured meats and a great place to go share plates. The restaurant does get extremely loud, service was fantastic -the food was good to very good. Tried the ox tail-like a short rib French onion soup sandwich(best Dish i had). The beef tartar was an extremely fresh and light take on the dish which was really nice. The chorizo was fantastic and the ribs were fall off the bone and not to filling. I would give this a 4.5 if I could but I think the restaurant lacks a signature dish and if I would say cure is a 5 it's tough to give their sister restaurant the same rating but it is close.",2,1,1,Positive

I have been to Pastitsio ever since it newly opened and have enjoyed coming here ever since. It's a tiny little deli with spare indoor seating and outdoor seating on an adjacent patio. The place is bright and decor is streamlined and clean. The lamb souvlakia dish is an excellent standout and my personal favorite whenever I stop by for lunch. The lamb is locally sourced and tender, the rice pilaf is flavorful and deliciously textured with mixed grains. The tzatziki sauce is light, refreshing and creamy and perfectly complements the meat. The side salad is served with a fantastic homemade Greek dressing made with high quality olive oil. The pastitsio and moussaka are delicious and I love the spanakopita and baklava. Chef Matt is super friendly and really cares about his food and ingredients. While I was in there talking to him one day, he brought it up that he caters as well (duh, it's on his website but I didn't think to look there) and I decided to have him cater my son's birthday party. I couldn't have picked a friendlier and more helpful catering service to do this. Matt went the extra mile to help me pick out dishes and set up the food for the party and offered all this at a reasonable price. Our guests raved about the food. The hummus, salad and pita appetizers were delicious and all our guests wanted to take pastitsio, soutsoukakia and baklava home with them! I'm not sure why this place has gotten negative reviews. It is, after all, a deli trying to serve home-cooked good food at restaurant quality levels so being critical of the service when there are only one or two people working the place is slightly unfair. I'll definitely be a regular here.",9,2,4,Positive

It was like lasagna and was delicious. The side salad is nothing to write home about but the oil dressing was perfect and had that light, handmade touch that makes real dressing so much better than the bottled stuff. On a second trip it was insanely busy due to their recent Groupon involvement. The service was slow but I had the feeling they simply weren't use to the amount of people coming in. Either way, my lamb gyro was delicious and the pita, as others have said, is perfect. Served warm and fluffy with a bit of crispiness on the outside. Definitely give this place a try.

Zen Asian Diner manages to underdeliver on both. The $12 rainbow roll was the worst rainbow roll I have ever seen. One expects a rainbow roll to be topped with a wealth of many different types of delicious sashimi, reflecting all the different colours of the rainbow. But the Zen Asian Diner version of this classic roll is distinguished from the California roll only by three paper-thin slivers of fish, plus some similarly millimetre-thin avocado slices on top. The $5.25 ikura gunkan-maki was about half the size I expected, being a mere 2 cm in diameter (try searching for images of ikura gunkan-maki on Google and count the average number of delicious red spheres and compare it to my photo). The $17 chirashi had a decent variety of fish, but the quantity was small, and worse, not very fresh at all. It is far worse than the offering from similarly priced Sushi Too on Walnut street. Generally, one should stay away from restaurants that claim to serve all the many diverse cuisines of Asia. Zen Asian Diner is no exception.

I'll also add in, while no one has been rude or unfriendly, it peeves me when I they are out of things or when I've asked for additional info about ingredients (like what's in your jam) the response is an apathetic 'I'm sorry' that isn't genuine or warm. Overall my assessment is that this is a good concept but it's not customer focused, i.e. not enough product and not a careful or compassionate apology or rationale from the staff. Good luck getting what you want of you go. If you luck out you'll likely be happy but with the pain of parking in the area and so many other options, I'll not make another attempt.

Since this place has been reviewed ad naseum, I'll keep this short (er). Cure has been on my list of places to try for a long time. Finally went with my DH last night. We shared the small salumi, the goat rodeo brulee, and the bread. All were fantastic, particularly the brulee. (I don't think I've ever felt like paying for bread was worth it before...) DH had the duck and I had a half order of the Tagliatelle. We both liked our dishes. Mine was by far the best pasta dish I've had in ages, perhaps ever. For drinks, he: bourbon cocktail and a red rye beer (blanking on which); me: gin cocktail (probably the only thing I ordered I'd skip next time), a pinotage (a nice change from the usuals you see), and a flight of amaros (DO THIS!). Service was very knowledgeable and perhaps over-attentive? Total tab was $125 before tip,which was more than reasonable for what we had. Bottom line: I loved the experience and the combination of flavors and ideas. If you're a foodie and enjoy eating as an event, this place is definitely for you. (Apparently, the mayor agrees... he was seated a few tables down.) However, if you are a food purist or think too many flavors clutter a plate, you'll think this place is over-priced\/over-hyped and might find the portion sizes too small. (If you think Olive Garden is actually Italian food or would identify a steak joint as your favorite restaurant, I'm looking at you...) My husband fell into this later category -- he appreciated the execution and thought the dishes were well-done, but the place wouldn't rank on his list of favorites. He said if we were given a GC and could eat for free, he'd likely have me take my mother (who would enjoy the meal more than he).

It was amazing such variety and flavor well worth the price when sharing with a group. We also tried the beef tartar appetizer which was delicious but towards the side of small on proton size when compared to the price, the sweet sauce that the tartar was presented with really brought out full flavor. For an entree I fell in love with the ""Gluttony"" this was a sampling of 4 different varieties of pork including 2 sausage a pork tenderloin and some fried pork hush puppy like thing. It was amazing just incredible, a great capturing of what this restaurant has to offer. The wine sauce and baked apples were a perfect sauce pairing for the pork.

Thoroughly average fare, really. The beer is nice, but nothing to get too excited about. Moving on. I ended up here with a party of 12, celebrating a co-worker's impending move to California. I ordered the grilled salmon with polenta, and it was ok. Again, nothing special, until I took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth. Since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy, I did a double take and took the crunchy thing out, rather than swallow it. This turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass. Not only that, but when I cut into the middle of the polenta again (on the grounds of ""this merits further investigation"") I found *another* piece of glass! Right there in the middle! Not huge shards (about the size of my pinky nail) but big enough to cut internally if swallowed. My co-workers and friend that I was with were all witnesses to this. I'll give CBW credit for handling this about the way you're supposed to: as soon as I told the waiter, he told the manager, who came over and was super apologetic. Obviously comped my meal (I got replacement food) and drinks, and offered me dessert to take home. That's great and all, but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food. I can see a completely different scenario where I accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries, or even just cut up my mouth; that story doesn't end happily for anyone involved. Most places you go, you don't expect this to happen. Doubly so for a place that charges $20 a plate. If that's the level of diligence that goes into food preparation at CBW, I don't think I could ever recommend it to anyone.",2,1,0,Negative

Kind of reminded me of a good quality tortilla the way the dough was crispy on the tops and topped with onions and sour cream. For my main course I had the buffalo meatloaf, and it was hands down the best meatloaf I've ever had. The meat was robust and flavorful and I don't know how they did it, but it seemed to have a grilled crust on the outside of each piece. It was amazing.

The dinners I had themselves were somewhat average, and not necessarily executed well. The crag dog appetizer had good flavor but I got significant shells in almost every bite. The jambalaya was also really interesting but the rice has numerous undercooked, crunchy pieces that made it difficult to eat.

We randomly stumbled upon it after our post dinner (pusadee's garden) walk. We were feeling adventurous and thirsty and decided to wander in. It's an old Moose Lodge- which makes for some interesting furnishings and a disco ball in the middle of the room- it's got a very charming dive\/lodge feel. Through the kitchen and in the back of the Lodge is a place to chill, play horseshoes or others enjoy your beverages outdoors. The crowd was a mixed bag- but the average age seemed 20 something. We were definitely on the oldest folks in the bar. The drinks are great- no crazy tender bar concoctions but fresh juices for mixers and plenty of beer on draft. My favorite drink of the evening was gin and juice-included gin, carrot juice, ginger. I also got the Laura Palmer - a fabulous bourbon drink! They have baby Budwiser cans for $1. On Sunday nights (we were there on a Sunday evening) they play Bingo (aka Bingo Bango) for a chance to win pizza or a drink. It's a silly, fun way to kill some time. We won and got a piece of pizza (yes, I know we already ate dinner thank you.) and it was yummilicious! They end Bingo Bango before 9 because they show Game of Thrones. It seems like it's a mixed bag as to whether folks want to watch or not. Seems like the staff isn't so much on GoT. The reason I mention this is that if you come here to watch it can be annoying with all of the other convos from folks not into it. But no big for us. The staff is young and friendly.

I had really REALLY high expectations for this place, and while I wouldn't say I was let down, there were a couple things that didn't quite sit right with me, ergo my 3 star rating. First, I called earlier this evening to ask a quick question, and not only did no one answer, but their voicemail was full.. not ok for a business in my opinion. Second, when we got there, the bartenders were really super unhelpful. When you first walk in, you step right into the bar area.. it's small, dark, and kinda cramped.. kinda divey, which is not an issue, but if you're unfamiliar with the place, as we were, it can be kinda hard to find your way around.. and when the bartenders offer no help whatsoever, it makes it that much more awkward. So we finally found our way to the back patio, which is really super awesome. We sit down at the bar, only to be told that this bar has just closed.. ugh! So we grab a table, which was fine, just not what we had in mind. From that point, the service was prompt and decent. Our server was friendly and helpful, and our food came out super fast.

I got the Shrimp Tacos as my meal, and they were good.. no super amazing queso, but good. My white sangria was decent. Again, nothing special but I enjoyed it.

It simply was slammed. Front bar was full and surrounding handful of tables. The back room, which has around 10 tables was also full. There is no list and much less reservations. This was very frustrating, jockeying for position to take a table when it opened up only to have the one person in front of you suddenly have their 8 friends show up and take all of the open tables. We ended up waiting an hour for a table for four. Not much of a scene, it really didn't seem like a lawrenceville crowd at all... definitely mostly people from Shadyside or the burbs driving their BMWs down to the new hip spot. I must say though, once the food came, all my angst regarding seating and pretentious other customers melted away. We started with guacomole and salsa, both of which were simply superb. The guac was simple, but creamy and satisfying. The salsa was full of roasted poblano goodness. The menu is around 15 items from $5-$12. The bulk of it are corn-tortilla tacos with various other offerings. Then my tacos came. Good lord, I am so glad I ordered the pork belly. Each taco had a healthy serving of pork belly covered in a spicy roasted, smoky sauce, onions, celantro, apple, radish and queso fresco. I really wish I could eat these everyday. At $8, the price was right for a sit down restaurant, but I do wish I could find these for lunch somewhere for $6. So, all in all, the food and service was excellent. The scene and having to jockey for a table for an hour really left me grumpy and will make me think twice about going again. Lsatly, to the table of 3 who had finished their food when we got there, and were still at their table 2 hours later when we left. If anyone from that group is reading this, what a low-life sitting there watching others wait for a table while you sip your drink and laugh about the wallpaper and run your hands through your stupid balding head of curly hair.

I love the double tortilla method which keeps the experience pretty neat-- I usually avoid tacos because they get messy, but these are manageable. The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options. The bartenders make great Pimms' cups (with cucumber!) and I really like the Carnation cocktail. The atmosphere of the bar is cool, the music is usually interesting and the back patio is to die for. Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear\/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it. It's kind of like a showdown in the wild west, sometimes resulting in a draw (two parties claim a table at the same time and a new sort of standoff begins).

Excited at the thought of enjoying semi-authentic Mexican tacos for $5 a pair, I knew I had to come check out this deal. After all, having closed for a few months due to liquor license issues, this place may offer new thrills and flair that didn't exist before. Our group was immediately able to find seats in the outdoor patio, thinking we were lucky that the other people of Lawrenceville were not taking advantage of this deal. We were served by a petite brunette waitress with curly hair wrapped in a bun. She went over the drink special and proceeded to take our drink order, all business without a smile (which is fine). Since we were a large group, we ordered a decent amount, and then each of us ordered 1-2 orders of tacos each, salivating at the thought of $5 tacos. Our tacos eventually came out, which came in pairs and were okay in quality. I'll never complain about $5 tacos though. We eventually got the check but were confused why all of our tacos except for 4 were listed at full price. After notifying the waitress, she gives us an empty stare and then says that only 3 of the listed tacos are $5. Mind you, the menu has no mention of any of their specials and does not explicitly say that only certain tacos are $5 during their Monday special. She then goes to grab the manager (or at least someone who claims he's the manager; he actually bartends at the front bar), who comes to our table and apologizes on the waitress's behalf by saying that the waitress is correct and that she clearly told us about the taco special's specifications. According to him, the only reason why all 7 of us magically did not hear her mention anything about the taco special was because we were all talking when she was going over them. To top it all off, he justified it by saying that she's one of their best servers (love high standards) so he has to go by her word. After all, the customer is always WRONG. Astonished and appalled that the manager was blaming us, we proceeded to insist that the waitress never mentioned anything and that a restaurant menu should have explicit information saying so. He then says that the sign outside the restaurant, which happens to point towards a side street away from the main entrance, clearly states the details of this special. Furthermore, he exclaimed that since they re-opened, they had to cut back on their specials. I'm sorry you guys closed because you failed to renew your liquor license; it was totally our fault.

Their tacos are pretty authentic with a bit of Portland thrown in. Every so often you'll get a pretentious piece of this or that but all in all, they're pretty close to the real thing. The drinks are mixed well and done right, using quality alcohol and a nice touch.

Next time around...and there will be a next time (the food was really good) I'll peruse the menu first, then whilst awaiting my callback...I'll pick a wine that pairs with that dish. Because of the Pinot though (and also because it sounded good) I picked the Pappardelle con Coniglio e Funghi...Braised rabbit with pappardelle pasta, roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms. At $17, I thought the price point was really reasonable (I know pasta isn't generally super expensive, but I still thought it was sane). It was earthy and had a nice balance of pepper to it.

Once we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. A lot of people keep repeating that the service here is bad. I guess I can see where they are coming from if you're a pretty high strung person who is used to being in and out of a restaurant and fed as soon as you sit down. The Coca Cafe is not this place and it's really obvious. It's a pretty small cafe and you're going to have to deal with a little bit of waiting. The owner, or at least what I thought was a manager of some sort did not seat a group of two while we were waiting because the rest of their party was not there. This is a simple rule and it allows people who are ready and on time to get a seat. In a place as small as Coca Cafe you can't afford to seat half of a party while they wait however long for the rest of their people. This might be considered ""rude"" to people but it's born of necessity. The ""customer is always right"" mantra is not universally accepted at every establishment you patronize. Anyway, with that out of the way. We were seated in less than 10 minutes and ordered two omelets. I had the wild mushroom omelet (shiitake and portabello) with Jarlsberg cheese, a side of grilled potatoes, and pumpernickel toast. My girlfriend had the tomato, feta, and pesto omelet. I got an orange juice with my water which was definitely freshly squeezed and delicious. After a little bit of a wait (see my earlier rant) we got our food which was amazing. The omelets were full and incredibly hardy. The mushrooms were fresh and springy with a tiny bit of crunch to them. The Jarlsberg cheese was so mild that I forgot it was in there at first; you can choose from two different cheeses so next time I think I'll try the other cheese to see if it is less subtle. The egg was cooked just right, a little crispy brownness on the edges and fluffy everywhere else. Nowhere in the omelet did I find raw yolk which I absolutely hate.

We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry. Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future.

Their Where the Wild Things Are chicken tenders were a great app to split and were served with fabulous dipping sauces.

The novelty of the whole place is what must bring people in the door. There was a place in Squirrel Hill a few years back that let you pick your meat and vegetables for a stir fry and they had since closed up and became the Silk Elephant. I couldn't really see a point in tipping a waitress when the setting is very informal and you are basicly doing all the work. They bring you an empty bowl when you sit down and then your rice and drink if you choose to order one. In my opinion if everything were like Chipotle where you get your own drink and no need to tip someone all the better. I guess I am just a cheapskate but when you are eating this kind of food you really don't want to spend that much cash as a whole. If we had a Pei Wei here in Pittsubrgh then there really would not be much need for a place like BD's. I noticed the onions were cut up all half assed where they leave the core at the end in there and don't care that it is all clumped up and stuck together. One of my pet peeves. Not sure what the draw is here getting your food cooked on a dirty grill by a teenager who would rather shoot the breeze than check to see if your food is burning. Watching him turn and chop my food (loosing a few select pieces of meat into the spill well during the process) with what looked like two filthy sword like utensils was not very appetizing at all. I think when someone else came up behind me and he scraped the grill shooting black carcinogenic ash into my stirfry was the final straw that made me not want to go back. I chose a mixture of about 5 different sauces that completely dried up once poured over my food on the grill. I couldn't really tell what it tasted like since it was so dried out and full of black specs of charcoal. If you want something similar and willing to pay the asking price of $9 for lunch, just go to a good Hibachi Grill somewhere where you get a free entertaining show by a real chef. If that's not for you either I suggest one of the better Chinese buffets around town and pay $7 instead and get all you can eat along with salad, fruit, cookies and ice cream.",0,0,0,Negative

It was about $15 for all you can eat bowl, I believe just one bowl was $13, so for the $2 extra dollars might as well go for it. Skip out on the appetizers, even for half off during happy hour, wasn't anything special. I took a quick peek at the soup & salad bar and it didn't seem to be worth it either, although I believe it's included in the unlimited bowl, not sure about that though. My other suggestion would be to put your veggies in the bowl first and then pile your meat on top. They have it set up so you do the meat first and then veggies, but I feel like unless you got mad skill, you end up not being able to put as many veggies in your dish and then your meal seems like it's missing something. Also, there's a huge selection of sauces and spices.. I kind of felt like it was overwhelming, because there were so many options and not really anything you could sample them with. So if you're not really sure of what you like or want, it was hard to try and figure out what would be good. I know on the menu they tell you some things that you can mix together for a certain taste, but it's not listed by the sauce section anywhere. First time up our griller was pretty good, but the second time the guy was too busy doing tricks that he didn't turn our food enough and it ended up being slightly burnt on the one side. Oh - what I thought was nice, is the waitress suggested that we get the unlimited for $2 and she'd box it up so we could take it home for lunch. So no matter what, you're taking something home. We went around 5, so it wasn't that crowded yet.. around 6 more people started coming and lines were formed at the tables and grill for a small wait (I know there were a lot of complaints about that when I read reviews about the place). Overall it was a good experience. Would I go back? Probably. I left feeling like it was convenient, something new.. but I felt like I could just make it at home.",0,0,0,Negative

My boyfriend and I could tear up some serious Junk Yard Nachos and my gaw, their Chicken Bonanza should be illegal for how tasty it is. I just hope they've changed the recipe for their turkey burger. I am extremely sensitive to the food service industry. I worked my way through high school and college in almost all job descriptions at restaurants. I've never sent food back. Ever. But the turkey patty was not the ground turkey style you'd typically expect. It was cold, minced turkey mush and it looked like it wasn't cooked through. If it were beef, I probably would have been fine, but because turkey can cause more foodborne illnesses, I got nervous. The server was apologetic, but explained that their patties are different.

The atmosphere inside of the bar is much better than most of the places found in the Southside. When you don't belong to the popped collar crowd of bar hoppers it's often hard to find a bar you can relax inside of in that area of Pittsburgh. OTB has some great ""bar food"" that is also healthy, most of the sandwiches and salads had the option of substituting seitan with chicken which is very appealing to vegetarians and health minded bar goers. I had the Rail Trail Wrap which was chicken, lettuce, carrots, and provolone cheese inside of a pita. The chicken was tossed in a perfect amount of Buffalo sauce (so many places put way too much to the point where all you can taste is the sauce) and the pita was warm, fluffy, and chewy. I ordered onion rings but the chef mistakenly made french fries. I'm a pretty ""live and let live"" guy so I let it go but the waitress offered to make a batch for free. I declined; fries are slightly healthier than onion rings, and it wasn't a big deal. The fact that she caught the mistake and offered to correct it was all I needed to remain happy. My girlfriend got tomato soup and a mozzarella, red pepper, and tomato panini. I am not a fan of tomato soup but I tried a spoonful and thought it was really good. It didn't taste canned and you could see small amounts of the tomato which leaves me to believe that it was homemade; needless to say, it was delicious, as was the sandwich she had. OTB is a great little bar that isn't just for bike enthusiasts. But at the end of a bike ride it'd be great to grab a beer there and eat a healthy lunch while watching one of their two big plasma screens.

I don't think I would have ever discovered it without Yelp. I first sought it out based on reviews a few years ago and I remember thoroughly enjoying a salad on the patio on a fine summer's day. Then, earlier this spring my partner and I stopped by to read the menu - my partner noted the sorta high prices and I noted the total lack of vegan options. Someone from inside popped out to let us know that they weren't yet open for dinner (it was b\/w lunch and dinner time) and asked if we'd like to make a reservation for later, all in a very kind and inviting manner. I mentioned that I was hoping to find something vegan and she assured me that the chef could make something. We passed that time (due to cheap partner), but I knew I would return for some al fresco joy, and earlier this week, I did. I called ahead to make a reservation and to make sure they were really ok with making a vegan entree. When we arrived, the vegan thing was acknowledged by our server and we were seated in the best spot on the patio, next to the cute and oddly gregarious turtles! We were handed some well used paper menus and our cheap sparkling wines were properly chilled\/corked\/stored. From then on, things got awkward. My dining companion, who kept baby talking to the turtles throughout the meal and even feeding them, coerced me into drinking her recently deceased grandmother's favorite cheap sparkling wine (Asti) and we made a toast to this woman I never had the pleasure of meeting. And we were left with crusty menus that which had no apparent vegan selections and waited for the server to, um, maybe, uh mention what they could do. Instead she came to take our order. And I had to explain that since nothing is really vegan on the menu, I needed her to describe what could be made vegan. Uhhhh, the mushroom consomme annnnd a salad...ummm...let me go ask the chef. The chef had an excellent answer, it is a mystery to me as to why he was not consulted earlier. I did try the mushroom consomme to start, which was alright (I would not order it again), and ordered the chef's special with was described as a zucchini stuffed with spiced cous cous. Sounded boring. But as presented, it had a lot going on, I almost feared it had too much going on - tomato sauce, capers, walnuts, basil, golden raisins, cinnamon, bread crumbs...whoa! Was it going to be as clumsy as our service? No! It was well composed and very satisfying to my palate which was maybe only slightly deteriorated from drinking Asti. The chef also sent out some complimentary small bites before our entrees, I imagine because the special dish was expected to take longer than a usual menu item, though it didn't seem like an especially long wait. Awesome gesture, as it proved someone was on their toes. At the end of the meal we had our second most painful conversation with the server, regarding coffee. It should have been a pretty simple exchange, really. I ordered espresso and my friend asked if the coffee was french pressed. Instead of just saying ""no,"" we got some bumbling convoluted answer that left us confused - I was able to gather that no, it was not french press coffee and that either the coffee or espresso (or both?) were from some sort of pod - like maybe a machine that sort of presses a pod...My friend, bewildered, just ordered an espresso, but I had to ask, soooo is the espresso from a pod thingy? Yep...ok, I am sorry but I don't want the espresso, and I joked about drawing the line at imitation ""champagne."" No fun. I tried to be really kind and easy going to make up for being such a damn snob, an inconvenience at every turn, for trying to understand what was being offered. As I watched our server describe the specials to an arriving table, counting the two of them on her fingers as if she was twisting each special off of a finger and squeezing it into her palm, I felt sorry for those others who came to endure her writhing translations. As much as I appreciated my special dish, and service aside, I probably would not put them through the trouble of having me dine again. I don't believe the menu changes very often, definitely not every day as the name suggests, as it didn't seem particularly seasonal (for example, one of their two desserts featured pumpkin which, even though it's none of my business, I thought was weird for late June), nor much, if at all, different from my previous visits, and certainly not freshly printed. Nonplussed? + Cash only (+ as in bring it) + Very pleasant patio for those rare perfect days + ^ With friendly turtles, until turtle soup season (maybe next year) + BYOB + Capable and accommodating kitchen to make up for non-communicative server = Worth trying, especially if you don't have dietary restrictions, you have expendable cash, it's a nice day to spend with turtles and you want to provide your own Asti. Hrm, the nonplussed point system might be my new method of expressing cynical optimism.",6,3,2,Negative

We had a reservation for 8:30 on Saturday, and showed up around 8:15. We had to push through a very heavy revolving door, and walked up to the greeter. She told us that our table would be ready right at 8:30, so we went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. We found two seats at the bar. The bar top was dirty, with a wet menu and the ticket from a previous guest at our seats. There were two bartenders, a male and a female, arguing over something. No one greeted us. Behind the bar, there were soiled glasses, utensils, and rags all over the place. Servers were frantically coming up to the bar to get drink orders while the bar tenders ran around and yelled. It was very tense. After 5 minutes, the bartender took my drink order of a Sam Adams. My wife asked what kind of wine she had, and the bartender grabbed the wet menu and flipped it over and gave it to her. When my beer arrived, the hostess came to take us to our table. I told her that I hadn't paid for my beer yet, nor had my wife ordered her wine. She said that it would be fine, and that she'd transfer the beer to our dinner check. When we were seated, a frantic male server came to ask my wife if she wanted something to drink. She ordered a glass of wine. He asked me if I had paid for my beer, and I explained what the hostess told me. He said it would be a few minutes for the wine, as he had to go to the bar to get it. I told him what a bad experience we had at the bar, to which he apologized. He came back moments later with the wine. He explained the menu, but never offered his name. We ordered appetizers and dinner as we enjoyed the bread and our drinks. Throughout most of our dinner, he was standing at the table next to us talking to another customer about his other job as an IT person, and about a business that he owned on the side. He only came back to us once ask if we needed more drinks and to inquire about our food. We still never got his name. My wife's dinner came with creme brulee, and she inquired if she could substitute for anything else. He told her no, and did not offer me any dessert options. He brought out the creme brulee and the check, and continued to talk to the guest next to us. At one point, one of the 4 hostesses came out to clear some tables as she ate a muffin. We paid and left. We asked if they validated parking, to which a hostess said ""nope"". One hostess said ""thanks"" as we were walking out the door. The food was great.

While the food was great the service, the logistics of our seating and table was despicable even with our early planning and reservation. My grandmother and grandfather live in Pittsburg and were looking for a good location to accommodate 30+ family members for thanksgiving dinner. We have enjoyed dinners at McCormick & Schmick's before and it seemed like a perfect choice with their thanksgiving dinner option. My grandparents went to get lunch and discuss reservations options for a group of our size months before thanksgiving (in September). Upon making the reservation they were guaranteed three large tables next to each other. We were cautioned to have our group arrive on time, so we could all be seated, but besides that they guaranteed they could accommodate us and make our holiday wonderful. As planned our large group arrived early or on time. Upon arrival we were told to gather at the bar as they readied our table. After 30 minutes (after our set reservation time passed) of waiting at the bar our group was over pouring onto tables around us, but we were finally seated. We were sat at two tables near each other and one table separated. It was as though they had not planned for our reservation or arrival at all. The table in between ours was an 80th birthday party. The group was clearly not in a rush, and I have no idea why the hostess anticipated they would be leaving quickly or on time for us. Since I have been a hostess at a large chain restaurant I know the intricacies involved with these reservations. Large parties especially special events should always be blocked for longer time and not dependent upon each other leaving. When we addressed the manager with out unhappiness in our reservation she was flippant and annoyed. She simply said, well I am sorry the other party is still not done eating. This should never have been a problem in the first place. Thanksgiving is a very important night for restaurants and we were appalled that extra time and thought was not given to the seating arrangement. The manager and hostess not only made us wait a ridiculous amount of time for our reservation but sat our party separately. The meal was good as expected, but the reservation, wait and attitude of the manager on duty put a bad taste in our mouths for the rest of the night. We will not be eating there again and I caution any other large group or special occasion to think twice before making a reservation. A side note- I am mentioning last because I do not think this is necessary but should be noted- the manager did nothing to compensate us for the aggregation that we were caused financially or in specials or sides. Our family would still have been separated on thanksgiving, but we would at least have felt the manager cared about our situation.

For the most part, we had a lovely time, enjoyed a nice atmosphere with good food and drink and decent service and it was the right venue for hosting all the friends we've made over the last 9 years. But I feel compelled to add that the end of the evening was unpleasant. I should preface this by saying that my boyfriend and I and most of the friends who were there with us met or currently work in food service and are respectful and understanding of business hours and closing procedures at other establishments. We knew ahead of time that the place closed at 1am, and we had every intention of being ready to go at 1am. But starting at midnight, the wait staff started taking drinks away left and right, rabidly clearing our tables if we dared to look away or visit an adjacent table. Then at 12:30, I was told I had missed last call and I couldn't get another drink. Fine -- I didn't need one anyway, but keep in mind my last one had been taken by an overzealous busser while I was hugging someone goodbye. At 12:45, we were reminded that we had 10 minutes left to finish our drinks. ""Great, thanks!"" we said, planning to comply. At 12:50, a wall of security guards more or less stood around us, and they brought a police officer over to cross his arms and pretty much just scowl and stare intimidatingly at us as we tried to say our last goodbyes to good friends, which, to say the very least, put a damper on the festivities. I got the sense they were looking for any excuse to kick us out. If you advertise your hours as being 11:00 am - 1:00 am on a Thursday night, then I think it's only fair to allow your customers to enjoy themselves until the announced closing time. Don't strong arm your customers into leaving before then. We weren't being drunk jerks, we weren't trying to order a lot of food or shots or anything, we were just trying to finish our drinks and say our goodbyes, but the waitstaff and security team just surrounded us with death stares for the last 20 minutes of the night. Had it been 1:15, I'd have completely understood and would have rounded up any oblivious revelers as quickly as possible as part of a cooperative and sympathetic effort, but that was not the case. If not for that, I'd have given them a 5-star rating, but ""last"" impressions matter, too.",0,0,0,Negative

It wasn't that I was against going there, per say, but my absolute hatred of the South Side Works and what is offered there--both establishments and personalities--made me think I would loath it just because of its location. But my affinity for beer, especially beer in giant glass mugs, and the fact that it was the location of one of my good friends 25th birthday party celebration finally brought me in. I arrived sometime around 11 on a Friday night to a line circling around the side of the building. At once I thought my fears were confirmed, a long line of what I perceived to be South Side douche bags. But as I got closer I realized that it wasn't just a bunch of frat boys in line, but there were people of all ages and all walks of life waiting to get in. On top of that the line moved very quickly and all in all only spent about five minutes waiting to get inside. Once inside I made my way to the bar area, which was much more spacious than I thought it would be. That being said, Hofbrauhaus was still extremely crowded leaving little room to stand without bumping in to someone or having someone bump in to you. The dense crowd also left long waits for beer. The bartending staff tried their best to keep up, but there is only so much they can do when you have hundreds of people making human sardines around the bar all trying to order a beer at the same time. I ordered a liter of Dunkel, and when it was finally served to me, tasted pretty good. I'm not all that familiar with German style beers so I'm in no position to comment on its quality, but from an amateur perspective I thought it possessed a strong and unique flavor. The price for a liter wasn't bad, especially considering the location of Hofbrauhaus. I believe the ""big mug"" ran somewhere between $7 and $8. I wish I would have had more time to try a few of the other brews but I didn't get the chance. The atmosphere of Hofbrauhaus is a bit more rowdy than I expected. Long rows of thick wooden tables and benches line the open space between the bar and the stage which aren't used for sitting but instead standing upon. From this perch one feels like he or she is the life of the party singing songs and swinging mugs about, beer sloshing out like a geyser. The band was lively, fun, dressed in authentic Bavarian dress, and I could tell they really did have a passion for the music they were playing, but I was really hoping for something a big more authentic. Most of the songs they played were American covers, nothing but a few songs were German. My experience at Hofbrauhaus was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. It wasn't as much of a corporate juggernaut bar like many of the other bars in the South Side Works area, even though the amount of people they allow to be packed in at once makes you wonder if they care more about their profits or the experiences of their patrons. Will I come back? Probably yes, but only from time to time. I much prefer smaller less crowded and noisy bars, but if I have to pick a larger venue bar Hofbrauhaus would be the place.",0,0,0,Negative

Everyone I talked to RAVED about them, but I found them to be incredibly salty to the point where I didn't really enjoy them, and literally scraped off all the salt from the pretzels.

But when our wings and side dips arrived, we were all lost in heavenly flavors of the best buffalo wings that any of us have experienced previously (or since). The quality of the wings alone clearly made up for any service problems.

This is a truly unique place. We woke up Sunday and our Air B&B host asked us if we're vegetarian. Mostly? Then we *must* go to Zenith for brunch. We parked nearby - I love how easy it is to find parking in Pittsburgh - and walked in the nondescript entrance to a hugely colorful thrift\/antique store with chairs hanging from the ceiling, tapestries, old paintings, and gadgets and (mainly) funky items galore. It took us a few moments to figure out we had to advance to the back to get seated. We were only two, and so we were seated immediately at a larger table with a few others. Since the main brunch item is the buffet, we walked over and stocked up, only to be asked upon returning to our seats what we wanted to eat. Ummm, the food we just picked up? Except you get an entree, too. Coffee or tea, a very nice brunch replete with bundt cakes (eight? ten? moist and delicious) and an assortment of salads (lentil, vegetable, Israeli couscous, pasta) and fruit, AND an entree. $10. I'm sure they make a killing on Sunday mornings (especially with a simple menu and no to-go boxes, probably to discourage taking more than you will actually eat from the buffet), but I thought this was amazing for a satisfying brunch. Everything appears to be vegetarian, with a number of vegan options. My entree was nothing to write home about, but it was not bad: I had a solid burrito with rice, beans, pepper, onion, and pineapple, though I probably should have asked for no tortilla. Lots of rice and a tortilla always seemed funny to me. I'm not gluten-free, and I've only gone this once, but I get the impression that there are plenty of buffet and entree options for those who cannot eat gluten or wheat. But if you can! - I loved the almond-chocolate bundt cake and my husband was making happy noises while eating other bundt cakes and his chosen entree: apple pancakes. The brunch menu of the week is available here: http:\/\/zenithpgh.com\/brunch-menu. Our table companions were friendly and local, and told us that the room in which the buffet is located was used to be an art gallery. Perhaps it still is. It does appear to contain more contemporary work. The service was great, especially considering the tightly packed setting: water jugs are available on the table, and our tea was refilled as often as we liked. There was no problem getting the check when we were ready to leave, and I was happy to discover they take credit cards. Highly recommended for a relaxed and filling meal.",0,0,0,Positive

It's worth it just to experience the novel concept of eating potluck style fare in a vintage shop. But when it comes down to it, Zenith's execution is very simple. The brunch buffet (only available on Sundays) is all vegan and exciting, but the food isn't really all that much fun. The cakes and pies are truly bad and the salads are average. When I say ""potluck style,"" I mean that this is the sort of food your plebeian friends or family prepare for parties - cheap and easy to make. The entrees are typically extremely uninspired, bland and obviously mass produced and re-heated as necessary. I would never even think of coming here on any day but Sunday (ok, well, I did once go on a Thursday; we were the only ones there and it sucked). I would give Zenith two stars, but I have to give them a little extra credit for business design - convincing people to crowd in one day of the week so as to require a wait during which people can shop deliriously (hungover and on an empty stomach) before eating. What they do the rest of the week is beyond me, it's definitely not creative menu design - I guess they are probably religiously hawking thrift store goods to re-sell...",1,2,0,Negative

I've visited this P.F. Changs probably 6 times over the past three years. It's usually because there are enough people at work who want to go that we all go. I found something on the menu that I liked and I stuck with it. Prior visits were unspectacular, but once I found ""Dan Dan Noodles"" I was set. At least I was until the visit before my most recent visit. They were bland in an ironic sort of extremely salty way. Do you know what I mean? I mean, it's hard to say that something that tastes like it just came out of a salt shaker is bland, but if that's the ONLY taste it has, then that's what my last order of Dan Dan Noodles tasted like. THIS time, I resolved to find something new to replace Dan Dan Noodles (can you tell I like saying Dan Dan Noodles? Because I do) for future visits. Meh. I'm done with PF Changs, at least lunch and dinner (because I still have a free happy hour dim sum for checking in on Yelp!). I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and found the Kung lacking and also no Pao. What they did NOT leave out, however, was the salt. Holy crap! The waitress (good waitress) gave me a replacement Mr. Pibb, suggesting I'd need it to finish my Kung Pao (presumably because it would be so spicy)...and I did need it. But just to wash down the salt. It was like I ordered a salt lick with a side of ...I'm not sure what...some sort of cold vinegar preparation of sliced vegetables. I was stuck as to whether they were pairing pseudo-kim che with my faux chinese food. Regardless it was not awesome. I'm not kidding when I say the most enjoyable part of the meal was the fried rice, which is not to say that the fried rice was good...it just wasn't as awful as everything else. People like this place, and I don't want my review to sway them away, but it was not good.

So I'd never heard of Shrimp Jap Chap, but that made it intriguing. The waitress asked me what I wanted and I told her, ""Shrimp Slap Chop"", but she didn't crack a smile and just wrote down ""Shrimp Jap Chap.""

I turned it over and over in my mind for what seemed like an uncomfortably long time, but for what was, in all actuality maybe a second at most. ""That's mine,"" I said. I wasn't positive that it was, but I figured that's just how you said it, if you were from Thailand. The rest of the table looked quizzically at me. I looked up. ""Shrimp Jap Chap. . . shi-sha-sho."" I gestured at the bowl of noodles with my fork. They chuckled. It was excellent. We finished and stood to pay at the counter. The woman there was NOT thai. She asked me which meal ticket was mine.

Although my bill set me back $12 (a bit pricey, especially nearly $3 for white rice), the order was large and delicious with a kick of spice. The rice was perfectly sticky. Service was excellent as my waiter came over at least a half dozen times. Will definitely come back, but given it was a Saturday I think the pricing needs to be a bit more competitive compared to all the other restaurants in the Giant Eagle district (about $1-$2 too high for most items).

No patina of cigarette smoke and coffee stains, like the tried and true diners of old. Which is a good thing. The service was good, I don't recall her being particularly knowledgeable, but how knowledgeable could she have been since we ate there two weeks after they opened? I also don't remember her being NOT knowledgeable. So. . . YAY! Now for the bad. . . I ordered a reuben. My friend remarked that it's hard to find a place that has a good reuben. I didn't necessarily agree, but said nothing. We both got it. We were both surprised to see it served open face, which, upon asking the manager (we'll come back to him in a minute) was because, ""It's the chef's interpretation of a reuben. He wanted to make it unique."" It WAS unique. But unique in a way that sucked. Like if the chef interpreted a hot dog by saying, ""HERE we serve our hot dogs with the mustard in your hand instead of on the dog. "" It was a stupid interpretation. Messy. And not good. Because the sauerkraut was kind of slippery, and the cheese was kind of melty, and the dressing was very heavy handed, so when you used your knife to cut it you ended up with half the sandwich still on the plate because it wouldn't stick on the fork, so you had a bite of cheese and dressing, then went back for a bite of bread and saurkraut and meat. It was sloppy and I ended up scooping most of the dressing onto the side of the plate so it was tolerable. And on the plus side there was a lot of food. . . but the negative of that was it was really hard to cut without food dropping off the side of the plate while you sawed at the sandwich through the meat. So then the manager came to our table, which I generally liked, but he was so aggressively wanting to nip any issues in the bud that he came across a little. . . militantly servile. ""Did everything exceed your expectations?"" he asked. Then when our grunts of polite assent didn't suffice, he addressed each of us individually. . . it was uncomfortable. I just wanted to be left to eat my shitty sandwich in peace. I felt uncomfortable complaining about my shitty sandwich, because it was, of course, ON PURPOSE. Did it exceed my expectations? No! But I didn't really want to interrupt my meal to have a discussion about it. I bought his departure by saying that I didn't really have any expectations coming in, so I couldn't really judge whether they'd been exceeded. Which was a lie. When we paid our bill. . . the manager was at the cash register. . . eagerly waiting to ask, once more, ""Did your experience exceed your expectations?"" UGGGGHHHH! I just wanted to leave. ""I don't know, yes. . . yes, it was fine!"" Ultimately, I will return. It was really close to work, and it's my own fault for not reading that they serve the reuben open faced. I assume it's on the menu that way. And next time I'll just tell the manager to go away because he's bothering me, which is more my speed. . . I was just caught a little off guard. If my next experience is. . . better (which will exceed my expectations) I'll update my review and add a star or two to it. Until then though. . . it was ""meh"". Diner food.",5,1,1,Negative

It has a nondescript sign and could easily be passed on as ""just another Chinese restaurant"". In this case, you'd be wrong. Ya Fei handles Chinese food and ""Pacific Rim"" dishes with a tastefulness not often found amongst the neon signs of box retail establishments. The food is obviously prepared by a chef who knows his craft and is eager to show his patrons. It does not suffer from what I call ""soy sauce syndrome"" which a lot of Chinese businesses succumb to; so many Chinese restaurants, in an attempt to appeal to the often bland American palette, cover their food in soy sauce to the point where everything shares the same salty, dull taste. Ya Fei is fresh, tasty, and can be as bold as you want it. Their sushi is also expertly made by a professional. Right next door is a Japanese steakhouse that boasts twice the price, half the taste. I love their dumplings and their kung bao chicken. The hot chilies in the kung bao are absolutely fiery when eaten but add a delicate spiciness if left as a garnish. Their ""pre fixe"" menu is also a great way to eat amazing food at a slightly lower price. It includes appetizer, entree, and desert. I cannot recommend Ya Fei enough to anyone who is tired of the same boring Chinese food that you seem to find in most suburban neighborhoods. Robinson being a huge victim.",3,0,0,Positive

We made an 8:30 reservation for a party of 7. When the reservation was made we were not told that they closed at 9pm. In my experience when a restaurant closes at a certain time such as 9 that means they stop seating guest at that time but they continue to serve the guest that have been sat. Not at this restaurant. Nothing was said to us as about the closing time as we ordered two nice bottles of wine and a seafood appetizer but as we were eating the appetizer our waiter came to the table and said that the restaurant closes at 9 and that they send the bartended home at 9:15 so it was last call. We asked to speak to the manager because we had not even ordered dinner yet and felt like we should be able to continue to order drinks with our meal. While waiting for the manager the chef walked over to our table and asked if we were going to be ordering dinner because he had ""payroll in the kitchen that he was running up"". This is a 2 hour type restaurant so it is completely unreasonable for them to seat a party at 8:30 and expect them to be gone by 9 or even to necessarily have ordered by 9. When the manager came over he offered no apology or resolution other than to go ahead and order any drinks we would like before the bartender left. This was unacceptable and as he walked away he was laughing and joking with the chef about it. At this point we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left. This is not the way a nice restaurant should treat their guest. The one high point was our waiter. He was obviously embarrassed by the way the management handled the situation. He was very apologetic and could not have been nicer even though he was losing out on at least a $300 tip. On there website they state ""Ditka's Hospitality is what makes Ditka's a special place.

I was surprised to walk right in on a Saturday night at six anyway. Get ready pay 15 dollars for a salad for two with bland dressing, 30 for three small pieces of chicken or veal, 24 for a larger bowl of fettuccine while they can't even include bread. We asked that they split the fettuccine into two bows as I like alfredo and she wanted marinara and I didn't want to pay another 24.00 for my own sauce. So they bring it out mixed together! They actually have a name for this like we were supposed to know. That would be something for the waitress to educate us one upon the special request. They take it back while we quickly ate the three tiny pieces of veal. So then we wait. Here it comes out and her's was ok but mine was terrible. The sauce, which I was told ""made to spec"", sucked. I had to go home and gargle to get the spoiled milk taste out of mouth. Almost like I had unpasteurized milk straight from the cow. We complained and they took the overpriced salad off.

It was something that had been run through a tenderizing machine to make it, well, tender. It was $16.99 so maybe I should not have expected the kind of NY strip I am used to seeing on a plate. When I ordered I asked the waiter about another item on the menu as I wanted to know what the sauce was like. He proceeded to tell me about pico de guillo.

(every employee we saw was tucked away in a different corner of a room with their noses buried in their cell phones) I ordered the chicken chimichanga with rice and refried beans and my spouse ordered the arroz con pollo. Where do I begin? The chips and salsa came out quickly and the chips were good but could have been out of a bag. The salsa was awful. It had so much oregano in it that it was like dipping in spaghetti sauce instead of salsa. There was no cilantro present, it was like they used oregano instead of cilantro. Luckily we didn't have much time to eat the chips and salsa as our food somehow miraculously came out literally five minutes after we ordered it. This seems like an impossibility to me unless of course it was already prepared and sitting in a bin under a heat lamp or in a chaffing dish in the kitchen, which is where I'm putting my money. My chimichanga was somewhere in size between a large sharpie magic marker and a cardboard paper towel tube. It was not fried like a chimichanga is supposed to be. The rice, refried beans and chimichanga were all completely bland and flavorless. How do you even get bland and flavorless food to happen in a Mexican restaurant? I was still hungry when I left it was so small. My spouse's arroz con pollo is supposed to be made with thigh and leg meat over rice. His dish was made with tiny chopped up chunks of breast meat instead and also lacked any flavor or spice. We had to get up and again hunt someone down to get our drinks refilled.

The place was only about 1\/3 full the evening we were there. Every 5 min one of 2 waiters would come by to ask how we were doing, did we need something, are we ready to order, it was annoying! Also what's with waiters asking if you want your water refilled? Please don't interrupt our dinner conversation to ask about tap water- just refill it! But this issue may just be a pet peeve of mine. Because of this over attentiveness we were rushed through our meal too quickly to enjoy. We paused from eating briefly to talk and BAM! Waiter at the table to ask if we wanted to box up the rest. No thanks, we JUST got the food. The place also needs a sound system so they aren't blasting music from a jambox on the pizza counter so anyone seated nearby is deafened.

We had great selections of wine by the glass and since I drink white and hubby drinks red, this is important to us. The bread basket with tasty little muffins and a creamy chive spread started us off. Initially we both wanted to share a first course of Korean Fried Chicken but after I heard the description of the melon salad with beets, peaches, tomatoes and hangar steak meat pickle, we each ordered our own starters. Both were absolutely terrific and we enjoyed sharing them. I really wanted the Scallops for dinner and I am now spoiled for life on my choice! They were huge and pure perfection. Cooked medium and spiced delightfully with so many complex flavors with the creamy sauce and basil vinaigrette, summer veggie succotash and roasted fresh corn aioli.

Some notes, it does get crowded and you may have to wait, so plan accordingly. They are also BYOB and there is only a .50 recycle fee.

My friends and I went here the day after Christmas for some quality Thai food and to let another one of our friends experience Thai food for the 1st time. Upon arrival, the restaurant was filled to capacity with only outside seating available. My friends and I decided to wait since we really had our hearts set on eating here. While waiting for about 10 minutes, the host told us we should be seated shortly since another table was becoming available. A couple minutes later, I noticed the server seated a family at the table that was supposed to be for my friends and I. So I politely said, ""excuse me, the host just told us we were going to be seated at the table."" He snarled back with irritation in his voice that the host isn't the server and doesn't know what she is doing. He moved the family together so they can be seated at 1 table versus being separated, etc. He said a little bit more but I cannot remember exactly verbatim but nonetheless his tone and body language were uncalled for. All the host could say was she is sorry and she is not the server. This is the 2nd time I have experience rude service from the same server. The first time I complained to manager and still he walks around with the same negative attitude and horrible customer service as before.

Also, it's practically in my back yard and I'm always up for some Thai food. The problem with most Thai restaurants is that nothing really sets them apart. If you were blindfolded and a number of Pittsburgh Thai restaurants set down plates of the same dish you'd probably have a very hard time picking them apart. Luckily, The Smiling Banana Leaf managed to carve itself a niche in the Thai-saturated streets of Pittsburgh. Just by looking at the bustle inside the restaurants shows you how good the place is. There's only five tables inside yet they are always filled with happy, hungry people. Customers are constantly coming in and out for take-out and the smells coming from the kitchen are amazing. The restaurant is intimate without being intimidating. The server we had was great. She was very upbeat and made small talk with us. She kept our waters filled and was attentive even though she was responsible for all five tables and a lot of the take-out ordering. Her warm demeanor alone makes The Smiling Banana Leaf the kind of restaurant you want to come back to. The food was excellent, by the way. To start we branched out from our usual and got ""Tofu Paradise"". The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft, warm and flavorful on the inside. The peanut sauce, something I usually do not care for, was smooth and perfectly balanced between sweet and savory. It went well with the veggies that were cooked but still crispy. The Tom Yum soup was served in a heaping bowl and had a brilliant red color to it. The pieces of chicken were hearty and the lemon grass was delicious. It wasn't my favorite, though. I like the soup to be really sour and this was more sweet tasting. To each his own, though! It was still prepared expertly. The fact that their dishes vary in flavor to other restaurants means to me that the chef is taking great care in cooking his food. It's like all cooking, depending on the tastes of the cook certain flavors may be emphasized or downplayed. I ordered the Spicy Green Bean entree and thought it was delicious. The sauce was spicy and tangy but also had some curry notes to it. Occasionally the spiciness would subside and you'd get smooth hints of coconut. Usually I'm not a fan of Thai sauces but I found myself sopping it up with my chicken and veggies. For dessert we had the epitomical Thai dessert, Thai custard and sticky rice. The portions were perfect for two people and much more generous than I usually get. The bill at the end of the meal was very fair and surprisingly cheap. The Smiling Banana Leaf is my new favorite Thai Place. It absolutely oozes charm.",3,0,0,Positive

Well worth the search in Highland Park to find it! We went last night with friends who are vegetarian and so we had a variety of dishes at our table. We started with the fried spring rolls - a little garlicky but other than that, fresh and tasty and crisp! I ordered the Pad See Ew with shrimp. The shrimp were small but they were plentiful. The sauce was a little different - it was a soy based that almost tasted sweet and sour - it was quite tasty. We weren't sure what ""temp"" to order things not having been there before - I ordered a 5 but would probably move up to a 6 next time as they are on par with the usual Thai restaurant we go to. It was the best kind of heat - you could taste it but it didn't build or last long, so you could taste all the flavors coming through. My preference is always heat but not overpowering heat. DH ordered his favorite green curry and gave it two thumbs up - while I didn't taste it, the smell was just heavenly (it was so good, he wasn't offering to share :(. The other couple ordered the Choo Curry Tofu which was a basic red curry with tofu and the Tofu eggplant with basil which was loaded with both tofu and what looked like the smaller Asian eggplant. The restaurant is quite tiny - perhaps they can seat 20 there. We arrived on a cold snowy Sunday evening at 630 without a reservation (we bad).

However, after multiple bad experiences, I will not be returning. The final straw occured when I recently had dinner here with 3 other adults and one toddler. First, upon overhearing us discussing the menu, the waiter impatiently asked if he was going to be ""dealing with any vegetarians"". We thought he was being rude to be funny, but learned later he was in fact, just rude. We immediately ordered simple appetizers so that my toddler would be occupied- edamame (which they store frozen so they only need to be quickly boiled) and the bacon-wrapped mochi (arguably one of the more popular menu items). We then ordered a bottle of wine. There are only 4 red wines on the menu. When we picked one the waiter said- oh, Ive never had anyone order that before- as if we had made some obscure choice. It was so odd and his tone was so accusatory. It made no sense. We tried to just laugh it off. About 15 min later we ordered our entrees. 10 min later 2 of the 4 entrees arrived, but no sign of the apps. When we inquired, the waiter told us it was because different chefs make different dishes and the chef assigned to the 2 entrees we had received wasn't very busy at the moment so those dishes were finished first. A ridiculous explanation- appetizers are called starters on the menu for a reason- you start with them! Another 10 min went by before the apps arrived. 10 minutes later (1 hour after we sat down) the other 2 entrees showed. 2\/4 adults in our party had long since finished their meals. At this time, my 3 year old asked if she could have some noodles. I asked the waiter if we could have a side dish of noodles (they have sides of rice on the menu). He said he ""wasn't sure"" and he would check. 25 MINUTES WENT BY- and my husband had to get up and go get the waiter to check on the status of the noodles we had ordered. The waiter told us he hadn't had a chance to ask the chef. Now, we are sitting at a table in front of the chefs. I could have asked for them by simply raising my voice! I was floored. I asked to speak with a manager and was told the manager was the chef and was too busy to talk to us. 5 minutes later the waiter returned and said he could not bring a side dish of noodles because the chefs didnt want to ""open another package of noodles"". Outraged, I told him we obviously would be paying for the noodles, there are noodles on the menu- why would he not cook them for us? The waiter had no response except to say the chef said no. As we left, we overheard the same waiter tell a customer that he had lost her reservation and he had no tables for her available. The customer then pointed at our empty table and asked if her party could sit there and the waiter replied, ""yeah, I guess I could set it for you."" Are they TRYING to NOT make money here and drive customers away? It's really unfortunate that this restaurant has such terrible customer service. On past visits I've had to wait 45 min for the check, and had another experience of 1 of 4 entrees arriving 30 min after the others (and not the Okonomiyaki which the menu clearly says takes 25 min to cook- this was a simple noodle small plate that just didnt arrive until everyone else was done eating- no explanation, no apology). I want to like this place- the food is actually really good. But I refuse to pay for such terrible customer service again.

It took me two times to figure out my feelings on this place. I studied in Japan for a year. While I was there, I prized myself as a bit of a foodie. One of my favorites was okonomiyaki, in particular Hiroshimayaki. Between the two times I went to Teppanyaki Kyoto, I got the Hiroshimayaki and a mixture of their appetizers: takoyaki, crochets, those rice cakes with bacon and gyoza. The appetizers were fine, but the crochets were frozen and not made from scratch. It seems a bit funny to be paying do much for frozen food ... Hiroshimayaki is a Hiroshima's take on okonomiyaki. Rather than mixing the ingredients during preparation, the ingredients are layered with soba or udon noodles and then steamed instead of fried. Ideally, Hiroshimayaki is much lighter in taste than its Osaka cousin. Here the Hiroshimayaki was so heavy it made my stomach ache, and the pork was a little too gristly for my tastes.

If you've ever been to the Sharp Edge you know that its beer selection is incredible. Specifically the Belgium Beer selection is unmatched in the city. Though I only took an estimate I counted nearly 40 beers on tap, half of which were authentic Belgian Brews. Now to be honest I'm not a huge Belgian fan--there are a few I thoroughly enjoy, but I find many to be slightly overrated. (Belgian beer lovers can go ahead and crucify me.) What I did enjoy was the selection of American IPA's on tap. Racer 5 made by Bear Republic Brewery was even on draft which is quite rare to see in this part of the country. Back to the prices I mentioned in my first sentence above; they are expensive so be prepared to pull out the plastic if you plan on staying for more than one drink. The Belgian Beers range between $6 and $11 per pint while the craft beers range from about $4 to $10. Though I think the Sharp Edge gouges you a bit with their prices you really can find pretty much any beer you are looking for. If it isn't on their tap selection the beer you are looking for is undoubtedly in their bottle selection. The staff at the Sharp Edge is great. The bartenders are quick, even during the early evenings when strings of business men and yuppies from Shadyside stop in for a few after work brews. The staff is quite knowledgeable too, I had a question about one of the Belgian beers that the bartender couldn't answer but she was quick to get a manager (this man knew more about beers and the brewing process then anyone I have ever spoken to) to answer my question. The atmosphere is unpretentious and cozy, but at crowded times the bar area can feel a bit suffocating. Two huge flat screen HD TV's are hung above either end of the bar which makes for a nice spot to watch a game.

I tempered my expectations but entered with an open mind. It's a small space, so reservations are a must. While we were seated I saw at least three parties turned aside who had walked in with hopeful gleams in their hungry eyes. No soup for you, last-minuters...boyscout up next time. We did the chef's tasting menu complete with wine pairings, and while I swear I was sober when I left, I can't remember half of them. There were bright spots: My absolute favorite of the evening was the Foie Gras Onion, Marmalade, Nut Butter, Balsamic, Brioche (from the menu). The waiter told us that it was the chef's take on PB&J, and if that's the case then I wish the chef was packing my lunch because I'd eat that every day for the rest of my life. The accompanying wines were also great. And I can't complain about the Tawny Port that accompanied the dessert because I don't like port regardless...so toss that. The plating. I can't think of another restaurant in the area that pays as much attention to plating as this one. It was beautiful. Often better than the food itself. Originality. There are a lot of great flavor combinations and ingredients that you aren't likely to find elsewhere. I like that. I like trying new things. I liked the use of liquid nitrogen to ""freeze brulee"" the dessert, or the palate cleanser, for example. New and different can be a fun little food adventure whether it ends up being amazing or bombing. Which I guess brings me to the less bright (but not deal-breaking) spots: There were a couple courses (the cured beef and the beets for example) where the plating wrote huge checks that the food itself was unable to cash. Not that it was bad. But I had hoped for better. All in all of the 8 courses I'd say two (the foie gras and the tartare) were excellent. The rest (including the aforementioned original dessert) were good, but not five-starrable. Wait staff seemed knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Space was, as previously stated, intimate.

I really enjoyed the mushroom bisque, but it's definitely for those who like strong mushroom flavors. The sea bass came on a bed of delicious polenta, which: I don't usually expect polenta to be amazing, but this one was. The sea bass itself was moist and flaky with tons of flavor. My partner had the lamb, and thought it was good but also suspected it might have been too raw inside (it was more than pink). The drinks were also quite good, if not stellar. Casbah also has a very pleasant atmosphere, even though it's quite large inside.

No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...).

I say this only because I am 22 and do not have $100+ to throw down on a dinner for two. Luckily, my fairly affluent cousin and her husband were kind enough to give me a gift certificate to this restaurant for my birthday last year. They said only one thing; try the Belgium beer and the mussels. My girlfriend and I got there and waited a long time to get seats, this place is seriously popular and in that ""quaint"" kind of way. This isn't Olive Garden where they have some elaborate seating system in place. Expect to wait a little bit, grab a beer or a cocktail, and just enjoy the evening. Once we were seated we ordered the mussels in red sauce, beer, and the steak and frites. The mussels were incredible; juicy, nicely marinated in their sauce and most important of all plentiful. The beer was great as all Belgium beers are. The steak and fries arrived when the sun had finally slipped below the horizon. The candles were lit, giving the small restaurant even more charm. The fries were incredible. Double battered so they are extra crispy, just how I like them. The mayonnaise dipping sauce was very good even though it was a bit of a guilty pleasure. It was creamy and a little tangy with the taste of basil mellowing it out. The steak was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection. I don't think it's possible to have a better dining experience.

I mean. . . we ate dinner together with friends, we didn't eat our friends. Who does that? We hadn't really done French food in Pittsburgh, so this seemed like a nice switch. It was good. It wasn't great, but it was definitely worth a second visit. The waitress was cute (not attractive cute. . . I mean. . . I'm not saying she wasn't attractive, I just mean she had a cute personality) and indulged our ridiculousness nicely. Dinner was slow-paced but that suited us. We were in it for the long haul. We got a couple appetizers: artichokes and mussels. They were both great. We ordered a bottle of wine and were completely clueless about the selections because, of course, they're all french and we knew nothing about french wines. Our friend spilled his wine and the waitress apologized and asked if everything was okay. I like that. I like knowing that if my friend spills his wine that someone else will step in and say they're sorry even though it was all his fault. Excellent work. So then we cleaned him up and the table too (although they line the tables with paper table cloths, so that wasn't a huge problem.) and ordered our meals. I asked the waitress to tell me what the Frenchest thing on the menu was. She said, ""I don't know how to answer that."" but then did pick something named for Marseilles, which despite being a city in France did not SEEM like the Frenchest thing on the menu. Since escargot wasn't listed as an entree, and they didn't have rabbit. . . I ordered something else. I got two specials, which isn't particularly instructive to potential NEW diners because they probably won't be on the menu when you dine there BUT. . . I got the fig salad, and a softshell crab entree. The fig salad was spectacular. I couldn't have loved it more if I were twins. Really. . . is lame as this sounds, I'll go out on a limb and say it was the best salad I've had in my life: carmelized figs with romaine lettuce in white balsamic vinaigrette with soft blue cheese and candied walnuts. . . it really was great. The softshell crab. . . not so much. Very tough, very crunchy. I had to request a steak knife to get through it. It tasted good, just a little rough. We finished off the evening with dessert, macaroons and creme brulee. Only they spelled it macarons, because apparently the French spell everything differently than we do. They have a bajillion different flavors of macarons. I ordered a caramel and sea salt macaron. It was pretty great. The creme brulee was yummy too. We had some nice strong coffee, paid and were out the door. The bill was spendy. . . take away the wine and it was still on the high side. It's hard to order a salad that costs as much as entrees do at other places, BUT. . . it WAS the best salad I've ever had IN. MAH. LIFE. So that counts for something.

In the vast ethnic food-desert that is Pittsburgh, Mediterrano offered REALLY good authentic Greek cuisine, New York good. I told all my friends about it, it was amazing. I remember paying about $40 for my wife and me, and thinking that I would have paid double. Fast forward a few years: I went back, and had the most mediocre Greek food...really it was terrible. We were told that the normal chef was sick, and that someone was filling in. Reluctantly, we paid the bill (prices had gone up), and said we would go back when the normal chef returned. Next time, we ordered in. We spent $100, and got what looked like $40 worth of food...and it wasn't great. The food was generally lacking substance and flavor. Most upsettingly, it was a really bad value. A Groupon came up, so we decided to give it another shot. We ordered Gyros, just Gyros: they were very good. They're not the best I've ever had, but definitely solid. I thought perhaps they had figured out whatever was wrong. Tonight, we went again...and this will likely be the last time. The waitress insisted that we had to order 4 entrees to fulfill the Groupon (which it didn't specify), and wouldn't let us use a gift certificate in addition to the Groupon (which is against policy I think). Our bill was $80 before tip. We ordered: Spanikopita ($7): We received 2 soggy little triangles of spanikopita. Still, this was the highlight of the meal...it was all downhill from here. Lamb Gyro and Eggplant Gyro platters ($12 ea): Greek salad was inedibly sour. The french fries were somehow both burned, and cold. The Gyros themselves were fine, not spectacular. Lamb pasta (dinner special, $24): The portion was small and it wasn't very good. The lamb tasted fine, but there wasn't much of it. The past and sauce I could have made better at home. I can't post pictures, but do the posted pictures look like $25 dishes to you?! Brisket Pizza: I've had this one before, it wasn't bad. Tonight, it was burnt and falling apart! They must have messed up the crust, as the pizza couldn't be picked up without falling apart (I've never had this experience with pizza). It's so sad. This was an AMAZING restaurant, now below average quality and very expensive. I think that as video killed the radio star; Groupon killed the great authentic ethnic restaurant.",4,0,0,Negative

So fast forward to present. . . months later. My wife and I are seated in the empty restaurant (we got there slightly before noon). Let me hit the high points first. . . the gyro pitas? Great. The lamb was tender, seasoned nicely, REALLY hit the spot. Comfort food Greek style. Served with a huge plate of fries seasoned in salt with crumbled feta on them. It's nicely appointed. . . a surprise coming off the seeming depression era end of Babcock replete with its laundromats, beer distributors and auto repair places. That was the HARD stuff though. The EASY stuff was. . . well not awesome. Waitress seemed very green. My wife's HM (high-maintenance) order of gyro sans tomato and onion was duplicated on my order, and the waitress seemed pretty content to let it sit on the table, even suggesting perhaps I try it without the onions and tomato to see if maybe I'd ALSO like it that way. She was EXTREMELY friendly. . . just. . . that's not really superb table-waiting protocol. . . you know? When I asked what the soup of the day was, she said she didn't know then asked (in a very friendly way) if I'd like her to find out. Yes. I DID want her to find out what the soup of the day was. . . how else would I know whether I wanted to order it? It was cold cucumber and yogurt soup, and to be frank, it was REALLY good. Again, the hard stuff is getting the food to taste really good. They DID that. When she refilled my sprite it was flat. And I HATE being that guy that sends everything back. Hate it. But the order was wrong and the Sprite was flat. That's EASY stuff. Get the order right and make sure the Sprite's carbonated. . . the food was AWESOME. I'll come back.

I started my lunch drive heading in the direction of a seeming recent yelpers' hang, intent upon adding my two cents to the flood of reviews. Lesson one. . . read not only the reviews, but also the hours of operation. Not only was my bride not open for lunch. . . but it was also not open on Tuesdays at ALL. Disappointed, I turned for home, wondering what I'd have for lunch since I'd been focused to the point of excluding any other potential venues from consideration, when I decided on The Flame. I like barbecue, pulled pork, etc, and it sounded good. I've eaten at The Flame (or rather ordered from then taken out) several times, and always enjoyed it, but this was my first visit with an eye toward ""reviewing it"". Unfortunately this was not my best visit. Waitstaff (the lady behind the counter) seemed not to be having a great day. Though she wasn't outright hostile, neither did she make any attempt to welcome me to The Flame, saying simply, ""Did you order for pickup?"" and at my negative response, ""What can I get you?"" I think that, and the amount owed (upon collecting my food to go) was the extent of our dialog. I decided to jump on the Mac 'n' cheese 'n' insert food item bandwagon and ordered the Stock o' Mac with pulled pork, and a side of sweet potato fries. I love me some sweet potato fries. I collected my plastic shopping bag and left the 'welcoming' fires of the barbecue behind. The Stack o' Mac was good. Really good, honestly. Upon initial inspection it looked like nothing so much as a pile of pulled pork on top of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Deluxe despite indications of home made mac'n'cheese. It was sooo much better than Kraft. I guess I'm not sure what I was REALLY expecting from homemade mac and cheese. That it would LOOK like the noodles were homemade? Stupid. It was velvety and sharp and delightful and upon further review, surprised me that the sole criticism of it was that there wasn't more of it, since what I'd really been drawn to was not so much the macaroni, but the pulled pork. The portion size was a tad smaller than I'd have liked. It's not a huge criticism, because I probably don't NEED to be eating more than what was given, and there was a hefty bunch of pulled pork on top of it. . . but I liked it more than I thought I would, and I think it would have balanced out the dish a little if there'd been more of the great mac 'n' cheese. The sweet potato fries were also good, but ""floppier"" than I prefer. I like a nice crisp fry. But these had great skin-on, earthy, sweet flavor, and when I got home and dipped them in a little Sweet Baby Ray's (cause that's how I roll) they were very tasty and I found that relative to the total experience my disappointment with the texture was pretty minor. Cost wise, it's not a bunch to spend. $10.86 for lunch. But this is Millvale. Relative to the surroundings and what the neighboring establishments charge. . . it actually seems sort of spendy. I expect, for example, to drop $15.00 or more for lunch in Pittsburgh on any given day (with tip). But Millvale? There was no tip to worry about, but also no drink. Seemed like a bit much for a bit too little. Overall, I'll definitely be back. I don't think I'd counsel anyone to undertake a journey to visit, but certainly if you're in the area and have a hankerin' for pulled pork or chicken wings, it's a good venue.",1,1,1,Negative

For the main course my wife had the mahi-mahi which she found to be delicious and I went with their signature veal chop.

It is a non traditional style tiramisu with shaved almonds. Very delicious. Overall this was a fantastic dinner out for my wife and I and a very appreciated wedding gift.

This is a long review but worth the read. I am a server and have worked in the industry for years, so it takes a lot for me to write a negative review. We arrived and were seated in a timely manner. At around 8:45 we ordered drinks and our 4 courses from the waitress. She came back a few minutes later and let us know that they were out of 1 of 3 appetizers (the only non-seafood option) and 1 of 3 salads. This was a bit strange since it was a small menu for the night and it was only 8:30! So that was the first red flag. Our waitress was nice but seemed like she wasn't trained properly to handle this kind of situation. No one offered us a different food option and we were basically told you can order from what's there or skip the appetizer and you'll still get charged full price. Next, we ordered a second round of drinks after about 20 minutes and it was a disaster. One of the girls in the party realized she was given the wrong bottle of wine the first time around and notified the waitress about it to bring the right one (she hadn't even drank one full glass of it). Never got it. Half the table ordered from one server and the other half from our server. Some people got drinks, some didn't. I was given the wrong drink and then not brought the correct one for 45 minutes! On a night like New Year's Eve after you've just told us that you're out of a few things on the menu, we should've been able to at least get our drinks quickly. One guy in our party ended up going down to the bar to order them because it took so long. The first course appetizers came out at a normal time but once we finished, the dishes sat on our table the entire time we were there. The salads did not come out until almost 10pm (an hour and a half after we sat down) and we quickly realized they used the same salad for the other two options. One was a bibb lettuce salad and one was a spring salad. Both had mixed greens. I understand if you run out of something to use something else, but the whole point of having three different salads on the menu is that they were supposed to be different. So that was frustrating. We had somewhere else to be and were getting very irritated and hungry. We asked around 1015 where our food was and the waitress came back and said about 20 more minutes. We then made the decision to ask to speak to a manager and let her know our concerns. The lady seemed nice but very flustered at what was going on and didn't really have an answer as to why the service and kitchen were lacking. After talking to her and realizing we weren't getting anywhere, we decided to pay for what we had and just leave. They only made us pay for the alcohol which was nice, and we left our waitress a 20% tip on the $130 in alcohol. Had we stayed, she probably would've had a $1500 bill and gotten over 20%. As a waitress, I probably would have stayed if there had been a little more customer service. We were never offered a round of drinks, or a discount for the appetizers we did not want when they were out of the one, and if they would've made a bit more effort, things may have been different. I know it's a new restaurant, but they were not prepared for the night at all. I would not go back on a busy night ever again.",6,0,0,Negative

I had a couple fairly simple questions about the menu (which was excellent), nothing strange, just straightforward questions about preparation and they were met with indecisiveness and an offer to check with the kitchen. No big deal but at a place like this, you need to be able to describe the ""surf"" in the surf and turf when it isn't listed. I was told it was a white fish of some kind. Salmon is not a white fish. Again, it was good anyway but I could see some being pretty put off by that if you don't like salmon. The entire main course was 3.5. There was nothing glaringly wrong, but the overall presentation and taste is not what I'd associate with a $45 price point. The drinks (pear martini and pomegranate Moscow mule) were 5 stars, hands down. Finished with a chocolate creme du pot or something. It was a solid 4 stars. In fairness, this place is a solid 3.5 stars with the view, but there is room to step it up. My suggestion would be to lower the prices 20-25% and reduce the menu to accommodate that.

It was similar to a more hipster place on Shiloh, with a nice selection of burgers, wings, and other ""better"" munchies. They also had Lenten specials. Lots of different draft beers and tons of bottles from what I could see. The bartender wasn't overly friendly (Problem #1... he seemed not too happy to be at work which is a definite turn off.) I ordered a crab sake sandwich, given it was Friday in Lent and it was a staple on their menu I wanted to see what they were workin' with. I think the crab cake is the ""end all be all"" of a restaurant--if it is fresh you know the food is good. If it is a dense puck of breading then you know what the restaurant is like. It was phenomial. I got the sweet potato fries which were just so-so (it's hard to find good SP fries, IMO). The bread that it was served on was SO FRESH that I had a hard time not picking at my pieces. The portions were reasonable and you could tell the main dish was the star of the show because they side portions were perfect. Sitting at the bar was the classic Mt Washington crowd-- the obnoxious frat guys, the mt washington natives, young professionals. I really liked this atmosphere but Problem #2 is that the obnoxious frat guys kind of turned the environment . I mean, there is no need to state loudly (for all the bar to hear, at noon-or any time of the day) ""Worthless Yinzers"" during a conversation with your buddy. I mean, you really aren't impressing anyone.

We were told that the people who had reservations at 6:30pm still haven't arrived and that we no longer have the option for a window table. She told us they were a whopping HOUR late for their reservation. She explained that the group was from Philly and got lost and stuck in traffic.

My wife got the salmon dinner with a side salad and french fries. My wife said the salmon was pretty decent. They had to send my plate back because someone plated the wrong sides with my crab cakes.

Guess I've fallen off the foodie scene. Anyhow, as a Bistro 19 fan, this place did not disappoint. Of course, the view was amazing and probably worth going just for a drink. The decor was modern and lovely as well. A tiny bit tight on space, but not uncomfortably so. (Side note: you could easily get seated in the bar area when we arrived at 5:15 and again. Around 6:30-45, it was completely empty again... This was Saturday night. So, if you're planning to stop by without a reservation and stay in the bar, it looks like if you do it either early or in the middle of the dinner hour, you're solid.) Speaking of drinks, they were fantastic. Huz had the East India and I had a French 75. We also had the charcuterie, which the husband raved about and he rarely raves. I was stunned as he kept shoveling meat and cheese into his mouth. Typically, I end up eating these sorts of plates by myself while he rants about how the restaurant thinks it's fancy... The popcorn was truffle flavor.... I don't really care for popcorn, but managed to eat most of it.... Delish and a fun touch. I also have no idea what they added to the butter ... salt and a seasoning... it was like crack butter.... For dinner, I had the goose goose duck, which was truly outstanding. I ate all of it. And I rarely eat meat. He had the steak, which didn't do much for me (I'm not much of a steak eater), but he thought it was perfect. And it was beautifully cooked. For dessert, we had chocolate cheesecake. He thought it was amazing. Again, not really my thing (or maybe I was just too full?), but tasty enough. The marinated cherries on the plate were my fave. Actually, I'd have eaten the cherries and the ice cream alone... And they sent us with a delightful little fruit cookie bar thing, so we really didn't need to order dessert. I also had a glass of delish zinfandel (with the duck) and a cappuccino (with dessert). He had a sparkling water with dinner. Total bill before tip was around $150. Completely worth it. Easily the best meal we've had in ages. And, frankly, if you had a single drink, still water, and skipped dessert, you could be close to the 50 pp mark. (Entrees were in the $30 ball park and certainly enough for a meal... ) But, if you're going to splurge, why not?! As noted by some of the other reviews, unlike a lot of fine dining places, the portions were very generous. Service was also near perfect. The server was prompt, polite and helpful. The sommelier was appropriately present and helpful. We thought about a bottle and he didn't bat an eyelash when I decided upon just a glass.

They took them back and brought me fresh ones and fresh gravy but either they took the new biscuits out of the oven too soon or they just nuked them because there was no hint of crust or firmness to the biscuits they were just warm and soft, it was like eating gravy over a hamburger bun. I asked if they had been bought or were under new management and I got a very quick and curt ""no"". So sadly J & J is off the future weekend list.",0,0,0,Negative

One of the managers, who is a wine afficianto, helped us pick out a good wine on the moderately priced side. The wine was fantastic. We ordered steamed clams as an appetizer and -oh so good- with their hot bread to dip in the sauce. The manager learned I lost my job and brought us a ""chocolate cake"" drink, on the house, which was very nice. House salads were fresh and a nice size portyion. I ordered the mahi mahi and it was fantastic. Nice size portion, fresh. Only complaint was that the lemon wedge was too small to put over the fish... Finally, the dessert...

I had the salmon done the honey lime style and it was the best salmon I have ever had. It was so smooth and the honey was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the yellow-fin tuna done port style. The sauce was great but he found it to be a little too rare (but he is not too much of a tuna fan -- it would have been perfect for any other tuna lover). We had the tri-color potatoes for a shareable side, the sweet potatoes were great, but found that we could have done without ordering the side. We finished off with the chocolate cheesecake which was amazing. I was worried that it would be too rich or sweet, but it was just the right amount and the texture was great. The pretzel and pistachios were a great complement. Overall, service, food, and environment made it a really memorable experience.

The momo dumplings were the kind of chewy that I love, with a delicately spiced filling and a most amazing dipping sauce. The sauce was pretty spicy (I detected what I believe to be habanero, yum!) and it did overcome the aromatic quality of the momo, but it was soooo magical, I would be happy to put it on anything, all of the time! And I was in luck, because more came with the entrees! The Nepali vegetables and the Indian curry were the exact same dish - we didn't mind only because it was especially delicious; appropriately spicy (this time more like chili and\/or cayenne), not heavy or oily and decidedly savory (not sweet like some Asian styles) with freshly cooked broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and potatoes. One of the veggie dishes (not sure if it was the Nepali or the Indian - again they were the same dish), came on a thali style platter with homemade pickles (mild), a little mix of greens and garlic, an *extremely* tasty dal, plus my new favorite condiment. And rice, both entrees came with rice - nothing too remarkable about that, but the rice did seem to have been cooked in a broth, maybe with a little butter (I'm not a fan of that latter bit, but I feel that it indicates particular care in the preparation).

The turkey I tried was very moist and delicious and the desserts are great but that was the only bright points i experienced.

The pot-stickers were bland and flavorless and lacked sufficient filling. Even the salad bar was lack luster in that it was missing basic staples such as croutons, green peppers, hard boiled egg, sliced mushrooms and other salad toppings you would expect like sunflower seeds and dried cranberries.

The other restaurants are equally disgusting especially that small one in the front that sells French fries and onion rings and what not. I'm not sure how you can make onion rings gross but rivers has the formula. The steakhouse\/seafood tastes like the fish is old or sits out long just gross. Security check in the front annoying !!!!!!!!!!!! Rude rude rude. I've come here on different occasions where I have been subjected to an extensive review of my id. Asking questions like what's my address. They repeatedly ask me to smile and measure my height like absolutely ridiculous. I truly believe they get a kick out of ridiculing people! My friend was completing her masters degree at Pitt during this time she lost a few pounds by few I mean probably about 20 the security guard proceeded to tell her that her ID was not hers she didn't look anything like her ID photo and was so rude about it. She had two different credit cards with full name that matched her ID. We called the police to verify her identification which they did no problem. Smh Like idk why the hell the security at rivers casino thinks they are the Secret service. It doesn't take that long to properly verify someone's identity. They swipe it through a damn machine. Half of the work is done just make sure the person is the person on the photo and make sure the id isn't expired. All the extra is just so annoying is the reason why i am writing this today. This casino is the worst I've ever been to and it's so sad because Pittsburgh doesn't have a lot of entertainment the best thing about rivers is the bathrooms are clean and the free beverages ( non alcoholic) Poor betting odds Wack machines You'll smell like smoke even if your in the non smoking section they must have the cheapest air ventilation system It's cold as hell in there",2,1,0,Negative

I've had the Chicken Tacos, the Chicken Burrito, Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Quesadilla. Someone on here calls it modern Mexican Food, I just call it fancy shmancy and artsy fartsy. No matter what I order it just tastes like it has too much pepper, a little sour and nothing like authentic mexican cuisine. First of all the Salsa sucks. It's just not good at all nor are the chips that go with it. I don't think many people are used to paying $4 or $5 for chips and salsa when they go to a Mexican place. I know I am not. In every other place on the planet It is free and usually arrives almost before you are handed your menus. Last time I went for lunch I tried the Tortilla soup. It had the consistency of a butternut squash soup with zero chicken inside. If I did not read it on the menu and was just handed a cup I would never have guessed what it was. Their Fajitas are painfully average, Not sure if you like paying over $10 for the equivalent of one thinly sliced half chicken breast and some fried peppers and onions. Just seem like less quality than I am used to recieving. The rice is mediocre and usually comes cold on the plate, the black beans have an over bearing peppery taste that I could definately do without. Their roasted red pepper sauce put overtop the Chimichange may be gourmet but it is too sour and tastes like stomach acid. Not really what I would call delicious or even a sought after flavor. I just never got this place. I think it is has more of a draw for people wanting to go drink in a trendy place that is popular with the 20 something dirty panty crowd. In my opinion if you want a good burrito and don't need to have a few drinks before eating it just walk into a Chipotle and pay your $6.50 and be on your way. Save yourself from overpriced food and over tipping the short stocky waitress with glasses, messy hair and no makeup on that seem to be in every Mad Mex.

If you order hot food they bring it to the table. Meals are under $10. My favorite item is their salmon cake with asparagus and wild rice. It was amazing! The best I ever had.,0,0,0,Positive

The hummus, baba ghanooj, salads and soups were all obviously made in house, not too garlicky but had a good punch of acidity that I often miss in this type of fare. If I was closer to Oakland I would frequent this place for lunch. I feel like it is similar in quality to Istanbul for lunch, but crushes Istanbul's Larryville location for dinner, without question. Beer only, Wine is BYOB without a corkage from what I could tell. Lastly, @ Jenny. I also had the Moussaka.

So if in Pittsburgh, you throw caution and your diet to the winds and try a Primant Bros sandwich. In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus. Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. ""Buy this stock, its a great investment"" or ""Marry her, it'll work out"". Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like ""eat it, you've had worse"", or ""so what if I'm husband number five?"" Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming ""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"" vibe going on.. Nice atmosphere, easily navigatable menu, (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"") a good mix of beers, TV's all around the room.

(Mouth: ""Get the number 2, I dont care, I hate this guy anyway from last nights tofu"".. Brain: ""We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want"") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread. The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer! The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!""). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind. Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich. No amount of ketchup could save it.. (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"") I probably should have just taken it out and eaten a cole slaw\/fries sandwich... Of course while I'm eating, (well enduring is more like it) the sandwich, the next table orders the pastrami....It looked deleicious, hearty, tasteful. My one time to eat at PB's and I choose (like the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) poorly. I wont slam Primanti Bros with one star because I had alternatives and only one visit. (Note to Brain: Stand up for yourself!. Dont let the Mouth make all the decisions, he only works here, you're supposed to be running the place!..) If in Pittsburgh again, I will try PB's again.

Overall, it's just overpriced and the food is usually either dry or unauthentic depending on what you get. The service isn't bad, but $13-14 for a small pizza is.

As an undergrad student at the University of Pittsburgh I often would head over to Fuel and Fuddle during the late night hours for its unique takes on classic American cuisine. But it wasn't until I took a seat at the small bar in the corner that I realized I was in a place that was so much more than just a good place to eat. The beer selection is amazing, literally hundreds of brews to choose from including pale ales, porters, IPAs, stouts, you name it and Fuel and Fuddle has it. On the wall behind the bar hangs the names of people who have at least tried 100 different beers. I even saw a plaque celebrating a patron who tried 1000 different beers. Count that. 1000 beers. That's pretty impressive. Around ten beers are on tap, each one is a different style giving the beer lover a great number of options to choose from. If the draft beers don't fancy your tastes then you'll surely find a beer you love in the selection of over 500 bottled beers in stock. For its selection of unique beers, Fuel and Fuddle's prices are varied. Draft domestics are as cheap as $2.00, but some of the rare micro-brews and import bottles can be upwards of $10, so if you are drinking on a budget it might be in your interest to check the price with the bartender before you order. If you are looking for rowdy drunken foolery Fuel and Fuddle is not your place. The bar area is entirely too small for anything than merely drinking. Furthermore, if you are trying to find a place to watch a game Fuel and Fuddle isn't really suited for that either. The TV's are small and positioned at awkward angles coupled with the noise level from the restaurant makes it impossible to hear any of the commentary. Fuel and Fuddle is best suited as a kick off to a night or a place to get a couple drinks after dinner. For a beer lover, the selection is unmatched anywhere in Oakland and can compete with any place in the city.

It's basically average all-American food, although some dishes just aren't well made. I remember I once ordered a salad dish with guacamole...couldn't finish it because I couldn't ask for water refill fast enough to wash down the over-abundance of flavor... Then there was a chicken wrap that featured really charred chicken pieces that didn't taste too great and was WAAY too salty.

Their French onion soup was alright, which I find to be the unfortunate norm with French onion soup these days. I had the barbecue chicken tortilla and black bean soup (say that five times fast), which was... odd. The texture and flavors weren't very appealing altogether. The entrees (with one exception) were the big disappointment. I will say, firstly, that my mother's Popeye Salad with steak was very good. My father and I both had the ribeye with baked potato and asparagus. The steaks could have been trimmed better, but I expect to cut a ring of fat off of my ribeye anymore when I order it. Both steaks were cooked perfectly, but they had no flavor at all. A little salt and pepper doctored that up instantly. The asparagus suffered from a lack of seasoning as well. And the baked potatoes were undercooked. I took mine home to finish baking later. The worst of it was my girlfriend's breaded chicken dish. The chicken itself was fine (although ""fine"" isn't my preferred adjective for a $20-$30 entree). The pasta underneath it was overcooked, totally unsalted penne sitting in a pool of what looked to be olive oil. The menu listed a ""tomato"" relish which just seemed to be chopped tomatoes and not much else. Dessert, on the other hand, was fantastic. The Italian lemon cake, Reese's peanut butter pie, and chocolate lava cake were delicious. We didn't leave a crumb behind. Service was very good, if just a bit sporadic. Our server offered to replace my soup (I declined optimistically), took the chicken dish off our check, and apologized for what we didn't like. Overall, though, the entrees kind of put a damper on the whole experience, especially at the high price point. I saw a few nice looking sandwiches go by, which are the bulk of their food menu.

I've had the lunch buffet a couple of times (seemed like the same lame stuff both times) and have ordered dinner from the menu on several occasions. Nothing has ever seemed very fresh and I've not experienced any serious spice here. The tamarind sauce (which you'd think would be their specialty), in addition to all of their condiments, taste generic rather than scratch-made. The dinner entrees come with a side of veggies or dal, and I swear they just give you leftovers from the lunch buffet. For example, I got a side consisting of crusty looking peas and carrots with random stuff dropped in; a lentil and a piece of cauliflower stalk. The rice also seemed reminiscent of buffet recycling measures. I hate to think of food getting wasted, but I'd go dumpster diving before paying $11 for food that most restaurants would either throw away for fear of contamination, or at least freshen up to make their parsimony less obvious. My Baingan Bhartha, a totally mild ""10,"" was tasty enough, however it didn't have any peas in it (it's supposed to, even according to their menu). Best bet is probably to order dosas, because at least you can count on them being made to order. I have witnessed some off service here, like this last time they basically seated a gal at the service station (a table pushed up against another table where they store and retrieve the silverware, water pitchers, napkins etc.), even though the restaurant was empty with the exception of me.

The salad was roasted red peppers, tomatoes and greens (it was supposed to also have pea shoots, but they forgot to put them on mine); fresh, but nothing extraordinary.

To make matters worse, I very slowly chewed on my extra chewy pasta hoping that our server would come by so that I could send my meal back, but he never came to check on us, so I kept on chewin' until it became apparent to us that we were running late to the theater and to him that it was time for our check.",6,3,0,Negative

""as good as it gets"" is a super hard description to live up to. Also, I have a really hard time giving out five stars. So maybe it's five star and I just have some weird brain thing that prevents me from giving out that last star, but here were my issues with it: It's not for everyone. Why? Well, for starters, the menu is pretty limited. If you're a huge seafood fan, for example, or LOVE steak...but neither is featured prominently (or at all) on the menu...you're sort of forced to leave your comfort zone to order. Now that is right in MY wheelhouse...I love trying stuff I've never had before, or never heard of before...but it's not in EVERYONE's wheelhouse. My wife, for example, had a tough time finding anything that didn't...scare her. So she ended up getting chicken. And not that the chicken was BAD. (it wasn't)...but it's nothing she'd order at any other restaurant. When we left I asked her, ""Would you come back?"" and she answered ""That's a hard question to answer."" Which means, that it's really NOT that hard a question to answer, because other places she'd have just said, ""YES!"" But she explained as follows: It's difficult to compare Legume to other restaurants she loves because she didn't get something she loves from Legume in order to be able to compare it to something she loved from another restaurant. Because the menu is limited, you're you may find yourself having to default to something you really wouldn't prefer, only because it seems like a better option than things you may have never tried. Okay...with that out of the way, a couple minor issues: The waiter wasn't super. He wasn't bad. But he wasn't super. That alone wouldn't have dropped this review to four from five stars, but see above. The bar was slow. This is sort of a good problem for Legume, but sort of a crappy one for customers...the bar was PACKED, when we got there. PACKED. So I get why the bar was slow...but it was just something that detracted from the five-ness of the star rating. The coffee was so-so. We did the french press, and it was fine, but not great. I love a good coffee with dessert. Things I loved: I had stinging nettle soup. Stinging. Nettle. I ate weed soup for dinner. That is COOL. And it was good. Sommelier. Any nice restaurant should have someone that can steer you toward a good wine that compliments your food nicely. Legume has one. Seriously...stinging nettle soup. I had the goat loin\/shank\/sausage with harissa and japanese knotweed. Do you see a trend here? They cook WEEDS and make them taste good. That's AWESOME!!! The goat was good. Not great...but definitely good. When I had bites with the knotweed and rice, the sauce, goat, and knotweed balanced out really nicely...but bites that were heavy with knotweed were bitter and because of the way it was prepared it was hard to get consistent bites throughout. Still...really good. Happy with my goat, I just wonder if knotweed was the best choice for the dish. Was it awesome BECAUSE it was knotweed? Yes. But could it have tasted better if it had been something less imaginative, but more palatable? Maybe. Pretty restaurant inside. I liked the inventiveness of the food. I liked the ambiance. I liked the philosophy overall. I'd like to have given it five stars, but I feel like it suffers from limited menu, less than five star wait staff, okay coffee, and maybe (ironically) TOO imaginative dishes.",8,6,5,Positive

Peter's Pub located at 116 Oakland Avenue has been a long time favorite of Panther frats and sororities. Like many bars in Oakland the downstairs drinking area is a bit cramped, but unlike many of the other Oakland bars Peter's Pub has a spacious upstairs area with another bar and a stage for live music. The beer selection here isn't all that great, most patrons usually have a miller or bud lite bottle in hand. I, being a fan of higher quality draft beer was disappointed to see not too much of a draft selection. I was even more irked at the prices; Peter's Pub is one of the more expensive bars in Oakland. Peter's has a number of gimmick nights to draw in customers. Country night seems to be a favorite, but since I'm not much of a country fan it didn't really thrill me. Anyways, what the music industry seems to market as country these days sounds a lot more of pop rock with a banjo. Though the live entertainment on certain nights includes many local live bands, Peter's Pub usually charges a cover. The cover is all that expensive, but it's just the fact that other bars in Oakland tend to not ask for a cover charge which annoys me. In many ways it seems like Peter's Pub has seemed to confuse itself with a type of bar that is usually found in the South Side. I have no problem with South Side bars, many of them are great places, but it's more of the fact that Peter's Pub just doesn't fit into the neighborhood of Oakland. Instead of being a refreshing change of pace, it seems to merely be a classic college bar posing as something hipper.",1,0,0,Negative

Don't let a coupon\/ discount deceive you- it's overpriced for value. Okay so not gonna lie the food here is pretty good. My main complaint is the lack of transparency with pricing\/coupon for here. I got a coupon for a free stack of hot cakes plain with one purchase. So i purchased orange juice. Then, our waitress told us we could get toppings and only pay the price difference. On the menu, the hot cakes are listed as $6.50. The extra toppings were 2$ more. So we both purchased the banana choc chip ones listed at $8.50, naturally under the impression that with the coupon we would only pay $2. Long story short, for something I expected to spend less than $5 on, I spent $10.15 + $2 tip. Even if I didn't have the coupon I would've spent less because I wouldn't have bought a drink. By the way-- approx 10 oz of watered down OJ in a plastic cup costs a whopping $3.

Cornerstone no doubt employs such good souls, however one bad soul has ruined any good thing I could say about this place. Our unfriendly bartender was gruff beyond what one could expect at the nastiest of dive bars. Other than one Michelob Ultra drinking regular, we were his only customers. He ignored us for what he thought was long enough for us to make a decision, at which point he came over and asked ""you know what you want?"" But damn, he underestimated the power of this girl's indecision, what a bother. I told him that I was undecided between two different weiss beers they had on draft. He promptly turned around and walked away. During his absence, I decided to just not get a beer, in fact, to spend as little money as possible because this guy had the air of being the owner (who else could get away with being such an asshole), whom I did not want to support. So eventually my partner got his beer (which he could have ordered much earlier if this guy had a molecule of patience) and we ordered one entree, a mushroom sandwich, to share with a salad and also a side order of sweet potato fries. Except for some rotten salad greens, the food was good. This could probably be a three star review if it wasn't for the hostile environment that we experienced. To top it all off, as soon as we got up to leave, he came over to the book to check his tip (guess what, it wasn't very good!) and sarcastically yelled after us, ""thanks A LOT"" followed by some indiscernible muttering.

St Pat's Party this year brought me in originally and the great experience each time brings me back. I went this past Tuesday for Free Wing night and saw a different side of Jamison's. It wasn't overly busy, which for free wings surprised me, and seemed very laid back. I met up with a friend there and after a few tweets more showed up. This is the the kind of place I can go to kick back and watch a game and chill and then come back on the weekend and turn it up a notch. Now for the food. Most bars on free wing night tend to downgrade the quality of wings or don't put much effort into it. Not here. Hearty wings and cooked perfect. The deal is you get 5 free wings for your first drink, 5 free for your second drink, and then $.35 each after that. You can easily come out spending less than $20 and I wasn't buying macro beers either. Come with friends and you can have all of the flavors. I had Chipotle BBQ which was sweet and backed more heat than their hottest wing, Garlic Parm which was well balanced on the garlic and parm, Buffalo Ranch could have used a little more sauce but I like my ranch wings sloppy. Overall this is a gem in Dormont you seriously need to consider and I can't thank my friend enough for turning me on to them. they get 5 stars not for one thing but bringing enjoyment at everything.

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was. Well, that was also the only time I had, as well. I was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee. They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee. I had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes. The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon. I went with the banana oatmeal. Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot. My food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes. I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon. I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs\/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes. The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon. Crispy yet chewy. I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory. Let's talk about the hotcakes. They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved. Whipped butter spreads pretty easy. I like that. I'm picky. Especially with breakfast. There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked. They tasted like a diabetics worst\/best nightmare. They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be. They would have been fine without syrup. When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread. I wanted to stop at one. I really did. I really really did. I was getting full. I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem. I had a problem with that second hotcake My other ""complaint"" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner. I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast. For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least. My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive. So, I will go back, for sure.

Fried zucchini ($5-6) is listed as an appetizer, but is enough for a meal, and comes from a local farm in Butler. The freshness really shows in the taste.

Maybe there wasn't a manager on duty. Maybe even a line cook or two called out sick? You see, I can only speculate because no one ever offered us a reason as to why it took over 50 minutes for our food to arrive. There were somewhere around 15 servers for a half-empty restaurant, and yet no one around us had food either, and many were still holding menus and looking around, even though they were there before us. Our waitress was new, which I am always extra patient about, but she was rude and simply didn't use common sense. On the way out, another woman approached a server and asked why her food hadn't arrived after 45 minutes, and the server just shrugged. The food was okay, but not great. I had ordered a side of bacon which didn't show up with the meal. When I asked about it, the server told me I wasn't allowed to get that side because someone told her the meal doesn't come with bacon. I said ""but I specifically ordered it as a side."" She said ""You could've done that I guess if you paid extra for it, but it's too late now."" Then right as she walked away, 2 sad, limp strips of bacon were brought out on a plate for me.

I would have been thankful for any place that was open and serving food when I walked in here. But, this turned out to be much more than your regular run-of-the-mill Chinese place. It was a place I'll remember for quite some time, and solely based on their food. Services and decor were fine, nothing to brag about, but nothing to complain about either. The menu was long and interesting. It has a long Chinese part and then an American one with popular dishes like Orange chicken, General Tso's chicken etc. Please do yourself a favor and order from the Chinese menu. You can stick to more conventional vegetarian, chicken, pork, beef, or fish-based dishes, or be more adventurous and try their rabbit or frog or maybe eel. I went with a spicy Chengdu style fried shrimp entree, and my husband decided to try their chef's special sweet and sour eel dish. They were both good. The sweetness of fresh tiger prawns within the spicy crunchy batter - it was indeed a delight. My only complaint was that they should have mentioned it's a completely dry dish. Having it under entrees and serving rice with it does not make too much sense. The eel was very good too. It was my first time, so I didn't know what to expect. But, I liked it a lot, and the sweet and sour curry was phenomenal and complemented the rice really well. I did not want to take any stars off since their food was so good, but this place needs to put some effort into modifying their menu book with descriptions of their dishes, or training their staff to be better able to describe their dishes.",0,0,0,Positive

We ordered ""Chicken Karage"", ""Yom Yam Men"", and ""Tan Tan Men"". The dishes arrived with just a little wait. The karage was extremely juicy with a great creamy dipping sauce. My boyfriend was pleasantly surprised by how much he liked the tan tan men. He ordered it with chicken and broccoli, but decided that next time he'd skip the chicken and double the veggies because they really stole the show with how well they paired with the spicy broth. The yom yam men is reminiscent of vietnamese noodle bowls with its lightly spiced broth and heaping cilantro. Unlike most vietnamese dishes expect lots of delish veggies rather than tons of meat. Really hit the spot for me. The prices were pretty reasonable for the large amount of food. You don't go over $10 a dish unless you add extra toppings.

If you're the kind of person who has never experienced ramen except for cheap instant noodles in college, then... surprise, surprise! the $12 offering at Ramen Bar is far superior to a disposable $0.50 meal. But, if you have ever been to Japan, or to any large American or Canadian city that has real ramen, then you will immediately realize that what the Ramen Bar serves up is only a poor imitation at best. I tried the shoyu chashu ramen, a classic dish that earned the Tsuta ramen shop in Tokyo a Michelin Star. At the Ramen Bar, the shoyu broth had none of the delicate balance of saltiness and umami that one would expect, but instead tasted just like any $1 shoyu-flavoured instant noodle seasoning, except strongly diluted with water so that it was even worse. Instead of richly marbled chashu that's sliced to 0.5 mm thick and melts in your mouth, they give you... stringy pork monoliths that are rock hard, tasteless, and take away all the moisture in your mouth so as to scrub against your tongue like sandpaper. Well, at least they give you quite a large quantity of meat, so they've got that going for them. The server was quite nice too.

(I loved it) Next, we had the potstickers, pork, shrimp and crab shumai, and beef noodle soup. The soup had large pieces of beef, was very tender, and really flavorful.

So we called ahead and they told us there were vegetarian options without egg and without fish sauce etc. Looking at the menu, there are very few, almost none, of such options, just one noodle dish labelled vegetarian (cold sesame noodles) - and it was with egg noodles (the server kindly asked the kitchen for me). I was struggling. We were assured that the vegetable dumplings were vegan, so we started with those while further considering entree options. Just when I decided to simply get the dumplings and run, our super helpful server informed us that the Dan Dan noodle dish could be made vegan, less seafood products, and with rice noodles! So we stuck around. The dumplings were absolutely adorable. And delicious! I'm pretty sure they are the best dumplings I've ever had. The filling consisted of shiitake mushrooms, some hearty green (kale?) and lil bits of tofu; very fresh and tasty. We both also very much enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles (I got mine vegan, my partner got them ""normal""). I thought the flavors of the dish were masterfully balanced, though I might ask for extra spicy next time. What was lacking in the dish was vegetables! Add some veggies to the dish, and I'd be giving a 5 star review. My most pressing complaint is about the music. With fantastic food, excellent service and a pleasant enough space, they should re-consider their music selections because nobody should ever have to endure the likes of Reba McEntire and Celine Dion while enjoying soothing delights of the east.

I guess it's a way to get you to order hummus as a starter; you can't say no when there's pita in front of you! Their fruit smoothie is smooth and sweet without being overbearing, the inclusion of honey is a nice touch, giving it a bit of added depth. While I cannot comment on the authenticity of their entrees I can say that their desserts are not authentic at all. At the entrance, behind a glass display, are a variety of yummy looking cakes. I'm not one to balk at cake but I wish the display was filled with baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern desserts to fit with the restaurant better.

The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own.

The nice thing is that they have pictures of almost all their dishes plastered up on the wall if we wanted some visual idea of what we were to order and there's Chinese on their menu too. The owner also speaks both Cantonese and Mandarin. Unfortunately, when we went on a Friday night, the place was horribly understaffed with only one cook (most likely the owner) and one waiter. And since they serve on a table-by-table process, the food for us, a party of 8 took almost an hour to completely arrive. At least we had tea to keep our stomachs from growling too loudly. Once the food arrived, I guess I expected more authentic Chinese cooking. The beef and chicken was steamed and looked like one of the healthy options you would choose off a separate menu. They had a nice variety of Chinese styled vegetables though and a very wide Asian drink selection. My regret is that I should have looked at some of the pictures before ordering because some of the dishes were surprisingly simple. Such as the shrimp & eggs for $10, which was literally a couple of shrimps put inside an egg omelet. I'm not quite sure how authentic that is... The decor was simple. There were just a couple of tables for sit-down eating and only two tables that could accommodate large parties of either 6 or 8.

Without having it from before I still kind of get that vibe. It seems like Mineo's makes some okay pizza but mostly rides on the fame it built up from its past. The store is small but you don't really dilly dally so it looks like you can usually find a spot before your pizza is done. We did. I ordered a large pepperoni and sausage and received a pepperoni and mushroom. My girlfriend hates mushrooms but the place was so busy we didn't feel like ordering a new pizza so she picked them off. The crust is ""okay"". It seems like it's trying to be authentic but was kind of on the dry side. In my opinion a good pizza crust should be crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. The ingredients were top notch. The mushrooms were good quality and so was the pepperoni. The pepperoni had the full flavor of a true pepperoni. Not that spicy greasy mixture you get from the store or from most pizza places. The cheese was really good and was slightly browned which is cooked better than most places but still not ""ideal"". The cheese should just be plain dark in some spots. Pizza should be cooked at high heat so give it the texture it was meant to have. However, it still kicks the butt of most places in the city. The once great Mineo's is still great because it's become almost a cultural landmark of Pittsburgh. It's a shame they seem to cut a few corners because it truly is the makings of a great pizza.",3,0,1,Negative

It's not the type of pizza you will find in most of the of the other joints in the 'bugh. It's very good, just different. Let me describe it for you: The crust is neither too thick or to thin and is quite flaky and soft. The sauce also is pretty standard, but the difference comes with the cheese and toppings. At Mineos the pepperoni is actually placed under the cheese. And there is not just a couple pieces sporadically tossed over the pie, but instead the entire thing is covered with thick sliced pepperoni. To top it off the cheese is layered on like an inch thick. I've never seen so much cheese on a pizza before. And it is greasy, I'm talking grease ponds pooling on the slices. For my tastes it is great, but i can see why other people don't like it. Have a gallon of water handy after you finish eating. Every time I eat here I am thirsty or hours afterwards. Like most pizza places you either love it or hate it. A large one topping isn't cheap, something like 20 dollars. But in my opinion well worth the extra 5 dollars to support a local restaurant instead of some chain.",2,1,0,Positive

I mean, it was the only reason I overlooked an entire page of great lunch deals and ordered dinner entrees instead. But I digress. Bottomline: RTC delivers lip smackin' good Taiwanese cooking. The Taiwanese chunk chicken was solid in taste and in presentation. Though it was saltier than the version I'm used to in Columbus, it was delicious nonetheless (although skimpier on portion size.) The salt and pepper fish was unique in its own ways -- the most notable being the absence of peppercorn, which boded well. It wasn't until I was perusing the extensive bubble tea menu that I saw the lunch specials along with the accompanying bubble tea specials. The pork chop over rice sounded promising and tasted just as good as the previous two entrees. The pork chop itself was fried to the right amount of crisp, and the rice itself could have easily made for a meal as it was the infamous Taiwanese braised pork rice. A good way of ending a meal here -- especially on days when scalding temperatures are reached -- is with a bubble tea. The lychee with extra jelly did the trick for me.

This last visit to the restaurant, I learned something very important and that is when you see a not-so-recently deceased clown fish on the bench in front of the aquarium where you would presumably wait to be seated or sit to view the otherwise lively aquatic environment, laugh and exit the establishment immediately. Don't sit there and continue to order a feast, no, don't. I, stupidly, was able to stop peering at and laughing about the highly visible dried up and flat dead clown fish for long enough to order way too much food. Our server was new and did not know Indian food, at all. We had to slowly repeat and point to what we wanted; neither English nor any of the many Indian languages were her first language, poor girl - she probably knew about the fish - we imagined her internal struggle over what to do about it...it being her first day and all, worrying about whether she should tell anybody for fear she will be blamed or yelled at or forced to touch it, or maybe she should just pick it up already and get it out of sight, but then what if somebody sees her and attention is brought to the fact that there is indeed a dead fish and that a person who is also handling food is handling a rotting fish... Sooo, enough with Finding Nemo and on to the deplorable food. We ordered vegetable samosas as our appetizer. They were flatter and smaller than the typical samosa, scantily spiced, and they seemed to have been frozen and microwaved (hardly) rather than deep fried. They were cold. Not greasy (like I think they should be). The chutneys and mango pickle all had the quality of having been born in a factory, canned, shelved for years, opened last week and sitting out all day before being served to us. I didn't try the papadam because I could tell that that too was cheaply manufactured. For entrees, the two of us shared Baingan Bharta, Aloo Gobi and a Dosa. The Dosa was ice cold, pale white and, well, I never knew they could be frozen without breaking. The sambar that came with it tasted like Campbell's Tomato Soup. The aloo (potatoes) in the aloo gobi tasted as if from a can (can you sense a trend yet?), there wasn't much gobi (cauliflower) and the dish lacked spice and complexity. Although the texture was ok, he flavor of the Baingan Bharta was completely overwhelmed with mustard (I realized that I had noticed this with my previous take out\/delivery too - so I think it's the recipe, not a fluke). The rice was basic fluffy white rice, with literally a few cumin seeds in it but nothing else of note. Nothing was garnished with cilantro\/coriander leaves, no cardamom pods were found. The naan was the worst I've ever had, and like many components of the meal, contained the essence of the package it emerged from, kinda like frozen pizza dough, nothing much like fluffy, bubbly homemade naan, ok, the shape was about right, albeit too perfect. It also had regular butter (which I dislike and do not eat) on it instead of ghee (which I will tolerate). They were somehow out of garlic naan (Giant Eagle must have been out. of. garlic. naan). The only reason I would go back would be to see if the fish is STILL on the bench.",9,5,0,Negative

The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior. D's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time, making them a great bar. Their fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious, artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.

If it weren't for the staff being able to rework the reservation, they would have gotten 1 star. What I remember most fondly about Buca was their garlic bread with cheese. It used to be served in this cast-iron pie dish. Not anymore. Instead, this gummy, undercooked (COLD) garlic bread arrived at the table. I guess cold is the theme for the meal. The house salad did fine but was sort of not impressive enough to distract from the cold bread. Wine was served. And drank. And drank. Because it took our food FOREVER to come. We ordered the traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 and a large side of pasta (when in Rome). After our meal arrived, we dug in. Turkey Breast (so SO DRY) on top of stuffing (which most folks liked) both were COLD. Mashed potatoes (those were pretty good, but cold.. If they weren't cold, I would have had seconds). Green beans (cold). We told the waitress but she was empathatic. The manager came out and offered to give us more food but because we had waited SO LONG to begin with, we dug in and didn't find it necessary to wait again for more food.

I took my partner to Eddie V's for his birthday. When I booked the reservation on-line the site asked if it was a special occasion, so I checked the box for birthday. When we arrived we were seated at a large corner booth with an excellent view of the restaurant and the table was sprinkled with birthday glitter along with a card. Dessert was on the house for the birthday boy. Near us was a couple celebrating an anniversary with rose peddles on the table. The food and service were as good as it gets! We shared a large crab cake and calamari for appetizers and had swordfish, scallops, & roasted beets for the main dish. All were cooked to perfection and creatively prepared. There is live music (not loud at all) and a relaxing beautiful bar area next to the main dining area separated by a glass wall. This is an excellent place for happy hour or to hang out before or after dinner. It was a Monday night and there were several tables of businessmen. The restaurant sits below street level and the ambiance is formal with white tablecloths, however it feels modern and you can see the immaculate kitchen behind glass. I don't think they have anything to hide. Our bill with a $43 dollar bottle of wine was $175 before the tip, I expect the average bill is higher. Portions are generous and side dishes are meant to be shared. The prices are justified for such an exceptional restaurant.

I'm a bit spoiled with my close proximity to Tazza D'Oro, what can I say. My large latte came in a tall, glass drinking cup which I found kind of cool in an off-kilter way. Kinda like drinking wine out of chipped mugs while wearing flannel. The pineapple upside down cake I bought was gooey and delicious. All of their other homemade baked goods looked killer as well.

Started with the fiesta cheese fondue which was excellent. Beer base, cheddar cheese and salsa.

This was served with a white bread, pumpernickel, tortilla chips, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, and Granny Smith Apples (not a good combo personally). Caesar salad was next. Pretty standard. Small but that was ok because I didn't want to get too full. Next was the entree. The meats were served with mushrooms, redskin potatoes and broccoli. We cooked it Coq Au Vin style (burgundy wine infused with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.) The pork was my favorite and hers was the seafood. It was also served with 6 small dipping sauces (+1 for lobster) which paired greatly with all the meats and vegetables. Lastly, grand finale! White chocolate Creme brûlée. Went all out and got the additional dippers. Fresh strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bananas, chocolate chip cookie, brownie, pound cake, gram cracker coated marshmallows, Oreo coated marshmallows, slice of cheesecake, cream puffs, Rice Krispie treats, and some rolled cookie.

It's cool how they've tried to recreate a NOLA French quarter-like look for the exterior, and a NOLA Bourboun street-like electrifying atmosphere inside. I hadn't imagined the place would be so huge before entering, but thankfully that meant there wasn't any wait for lunch on a busy Christmas weekend. Loved the ambience and the decor inside, cool yet classy. Our waiter let us know that they were out of a couple of the menu items due to the Christmas craziness. No issues, the menu still had a number of tempting options. I stuck to classic Jambalaya, while my husband opted for the NOLA burger. Both of them were spot on. I loved the complex flavors of the jambalaya and the generous portions of meat and shrimp. So what's not to like about this place? The service. Well, I'm not sure if it was a one-off experience for us, since other Yelpers seem to be happy with the service. I understand that it was Christmas weekend, but the painfully slow service when the restaurant was half-empty is not quite acceptable. The waiter came to take our order minutes after we arrived, and when we said we needed some time to look through the menu, he went on a mini-vacation. Once he finally took our order, he went on a world-tour..our food took forever to arrive. No explanations for the delay, not even an update, our waiter seemed to really hate our table.

I was headed to a local lunch spot downtown earlier than usual due to a 12:30 meeting (12:30? seriously?) and this was the first place we found that was serving lunch to the 1st lunch period crowd (remember those poor kids in elementary school that pulled the short straw and ate lunch at 11 AM - that was us that day). Now I am not a drinker. My dog imbibes more than I do, so the beer list was kind of lost on me (besides, I always think it is bad mojo to go into a meeting after lunch and wreak of anything, especially alcohol). My CW and I were the first to be seated - maybe that was our mistake. She ordered the quiche of the day and I ordered a sirloin burger w\/ sweet potato fries. Her salad was okay. Nice greens although not much else going on in it. From there, it went straight downhill. When CW's quiche arrived, it was lovely to look at - leeks and andouille sausage - and cold. Not warm, not cooler than you would prefer. It was flipping cold. So she explained that to the waiter who took it back. Then she waited and waited and waited. Expecting it to be nuked, this was taking quite a while. When he brought the plate out, it was a new piece of quiche - he explained that when they tried to heat up the original piece, it crumbled so they made a new quiche. As a former waitstaff (waitress but trying to be PC here), I would have stayed around and made sure that this piece was more to her liking. But he bolted. And - you guessed - this piece was equally as bad. Now I know - you are going to say she was picky. But I actually touched the quiche to allay my fears and it was flipping cold. My guess? The quiches were either chilled or frozen and they didn't know how to reheat them. She ended up with a 1\/2 of a chicken salad panini with dried cherries although I will be darned if there were any dried cherries in it. So CW is going vote this bistro off the island. My lunch? I ordered the Brew-a-Burger Sirloin rare. When it came, I don't think it was much warmer than CW's quiche - yes, I order it rare and expect the inside to be warm but I also expect the outside to be hot which it wasn't. The cheese sat on the top and never softened, let alone melted. I also expect a rare burger to be flavorful without the addition of much else - and it wasn't. About 1\/2 way through, I almost wondered if they had given me a ground chicken burger in error. At that point, I figured it was not worth pursuing. Should they have given CW a free lunch? Or a GC for a free lunch upon a return visit? Doesn't matter what they should have done as they did nothing - the bill arrived and was paid as expected. All in all, it was not a great food experience. I don't think we will be returning for lunch anytime soon. Was it a bad day for the kitchen? Did we arrive before they were really ready to serve lunch? Not sure but, either way, when you spend $25 plus tip for lunch, I think there are better places to drop it. Pity the kitchen staff cannot live up to the restaurant's name.",2,0,0,Negative

Isn't it customary to provide a copy of the receipt when you deliver on the east coast? I'm from California and that's freaking standard, man! Wouldn't you think if you're delivering to a hotel, the person is probably traveling for business and would need to provide supporting receipts in order to receive reimbursement for meal expenses? Come on now! So I kindly asked the hotel front desk to make a copy of the receipt. They were taking some time to make a copy so we stood there awkwardly trying NOT to make eye contact because it was OBVIOUS he was annoyed. Hey buddy, don't be upset with me because you hate your job! When I gave him the receipt and said thank you (yes, I still was polite even through all the awkwardness), he just walked away. No bye, no have a great night, no nothing. I don't know why I was expecting anything more from this guy. Maybe I would have had a better experience if I walked in to place my order instead, but judging on the previous reviews, I highly doubt that.",2,1,1,Negative

We sat and waited without anyone coming outside to acknowledge us (not sure how long?). So I went back in the door and let the next person that came to seat me that we were sitting outside and just interested in dessert.

Dining companions enjoyed the pasta trio (neverending bowl of house-made selections) as well as the fish special (Brazilian tiger fish). 17 bucks for house-made pasta, and as much as you want, is a great deal.

I first hit CL at lunch with some coworkers when I was working down in the Strip. They so raved about it - and they are not ""ethnic"" eaters - that I had to try it. All I can say is ""oh my"". This burrito was both quantity and quality. It was overstuffed with rice, black beans, this fantastic Peruvian chicken, and cheese. I realized immediately that this burrito was fantastically tasty and, unfortunately, too much for one lunch..... so I polished the entire thing off anyway. It took twice as long to walk back to work as it did to get there.... but it was so worth it. And, for less than the price of a fast-food burger, I was in burrito heaven. So, of course, then it was a matter of taking DH there on a weekend. We had been walking the strip for hours and were famished having skipped breakfast and lunch and it was late afternoon, so we ordered heartily - he got a burrito, I ordered a quesadilla, and we split a bowl of tortilla soup along with an order of nachos. I don't know what they do to their salsa but, damn, it is tasty. It has such a nice light kick to it - not enough to keep your tongue burning, just enough to make it tasty - and those chips. I don't know. Maybe they dust them with crack cocaine - they are totally addictive. I don't know what makes them so good but they truly are fantastic. The quesadilla was HUGE. And stuffed nicely with chicken, rice, black beans, and cheese . 1\/2 of it came home and the teenager ate it later. The tortilla soup was very good. Nicely spiced. Not too junked up with stuff (I hate when they throw so much cheese and strips on the top that you feel like you are eating the Mexican version of French onion soup). Having hit it several times since then for lunch, we made it down again over the weekend with DH and TS before the Pittsburgh Power game - and we heartily dug in and enjoyed our meal immensely. The waitstaff is friendly and fun - they are attentive and helpful when you are ordering. Prices are soooo reasonable. There are not many places where you can feed three adults - with a lot of leftovers to go home - for about $10-12 a person. And we could have easily spent less if we didn't want the leftovers - but what fun would that be??? I hate to recommend this place because I hate to see it become crowded like that place across the street on weekends ;) but I have to share this place - it is so good and they deserve to be a huge success.

Their fried burritos are crunchy and gooey on the inside and, with a splash of their verde sauce, taste like heaven. Their rotisserie chicken is seasoned well and goes well with their black beans and spanish rice. What really steals the show and is my undisputed favorite item on the meny is their carnitas. They're only served on the weekends but they're delicious. Fork tender and with a bit of fat for flavor, put a bit in your fresh tortilla with some rice and beans and a splash of verde for heat. What happens is what I suspect occurs right before you take your first breath; this otherworldly sense of peace. Everyone working there is great, too.

The hostess told us 15-20 minutes, so my sister and I went to the bar for a quick drink. There are no beers on draft, and the bottles are a bit pricy. House wines are $6, which is normal. The bartender was probably the worst part of the entire experience -- he just stared at us without saying anything for a good half a minute, then he said, a bit rudely, ""do you need something?!"" He gave us our drinks and our checks without a word, then walked away. By the time we paid for our drinks, our table was ready. Our waitress, Missy, was very attentive, funny, and nice. We came for the all you can eat crabs, and she never let us run out. She brought us water without asking, and kept checking in on us. My sister is what I would call a crab connoisseur, and she said they had the best crab legs she's ever had. Instead of boiling them, they use a $25,000 steamer, so it's worth the extra money! For $36 you get (all you can eat) the best crab legs, fries, a salad, and veggies. It's a wonderful view of the river, but it is kind of weird that they allow smoking when most people go there for the deck.

Lots of interesting ideas. Unique preparations. But...the food falls just a little short. Do I love any place that tries new things? (Pop rocks in sushi, buzz buttons and dry ice with drinks) Yes. Did those things turn out as amazing as I'd hoped? No. Originally started reviewing this as a 3 overall and then realized I was reminiscing about all the really fun things and 3 was too low. This seems like it would be an amazing happy hour hangout. The drinks, while not out of this world, were fun and innovative. I had a sake boat (which was like an irish car bomb but with sake and bud light) that sort of missed the mark with the crappy beer. I'm thinking next time maybe Sapporo? I had a drink with a buzz button, ""Szechuan Buzz"" (little saliva-inducing edible flower that makes your mouth feel like it's ""buzzing"") and one with dry ice that I can't remember the name of (always a fun effect). But none of the drinks I ordered were actually good drinks. They were just...fun. Novel. A friend ordered a bourbon drink ""Yuzu Spice"" that was a bit strong for her, but I tried it and it was actually the best drink we ordered. The appetizers (steer clear of the bok choy, which came to the table a bit gritty and had to be taken off the bill) ranged from good to great, with the Ki King Broccoli being hands down the best, and the Chee Chee Fried Brussels Sprouts giving my Pittsburgh favorites a run for their money. The shishito peppers underwhelmed, the bonito flakes sometimes gave them a fishy taste that was offputting and the peppers were on the mild side. The Jicama Spring Roll seemed bland, but I also didn't dip it in anything. The Ki King broccoli and Chee Chee fried bussels sprouts deserve another mention. The broccoli was completely different than any preparation I'd had before and it was amazing. I'd have ordered more. I'd have eaten it all night. It's that good. The brussels sprouts too...it seems like everyone is on board the brussels sprouts express right now, but these were as good as any place in the city...and I've tried a LOT of brussels sprouts. We didn't actually order the entrees, but got a little sushi. I ordered the roll with pop rocks, and initial bites were a little...""off"". I got a really strong candy taste in the first one, and it was sort of jarring. I think it was just a bad bite though, the rest was really good, although the pop rocks themselves weren't really contributing much to the overall taste. The Poke Aloha was great. I'd recommend steering clear of the Pop Rocks and trying that (unless you, like me, need the new experience. Just to see). Service was great. The waitress was high energy (I think you have to be, the place was loud and busy). Atmosphere was great...if you like loud and high energy.

We started at the bar where we waited for some of our group to arrive as we were the first there. The drinks were really great, but our bartenders lacked so much personality that it was sickening.

In my opinion, considering how loud and difficult I'm sure we were, our server did a great job and I never really felt like he was burdened or impatient with us. We sat in a semi-private area (thank God) which was really nice, for us and those around us, and it was the perfect setting for our group.

I like the steel and the long quiet factories and warehouses of the industrial revolution which have become restaurants or quietly stand guard around the city. I don't know who did the design for Eleven but it's a great space. A transformed warehouse in the Strip - the space is airy and the lighting and tall windows beautiful. The walls are a gun metal grey and high on one wall is what looks like a scrolling metal gate. There are lots of cozy booths and overall the noise level in the dining room is good for conversation. I was fortunate to be here in summer and all around the outside of the restaurant were the most beautiful pots - cascading foliage of green and burgundy shades. I know they don't need to do this, but I noticed this detail. In summer there is a nice terrace that is shielded from the street by these pots. I love open kitchens. This is an ingredient based restaurant that has access to the best of Pennsylvania farms. It was fun to see baskets of peaches lining the stainless steel shelves in front of the kitchen. Of course we had the peach ice cream sandwich for dessert! The service was great - friendly and just the right amount of checking in. Wine list offers choice for all budgets. We chose a Russian River Pinot Noir - Row Eleven and it was excellent. I appreciated being served the bread of our choice instead of a basket on the table. They offer a selection and all were great - semolina, salted foccacia, and a wheat with currants. The menu offered great choice among tasting menus and tasting entrees. I love this concept and so we had the Seafood Tasting entree. Everything was beautifully plated and excellent. Perfectly done salmon atop cucumbers and potatoes, Halibut with roasted tomatoes and a crab cake among the best I've had. I wish more restaurants would do this. We also had an excellent salad which they offered to split. For start we had the lamb taco and everything about this dish worked. Every bite was heaven - pulled lamb, lentils, corn, cilantro....

Nothing they serve is entirely challenging but for a lot of Pittsburghers, it probably appears that way. Either way, there's no way to argue about the quality of the food. The ingredients are seasonal and local and the cooking is inspired. Eleven is probably the most upscale of the Big Burrito restaurants but the stuffiness that comes with that atmosphere is wholly missing. I love being able to order food off a restaurant's menu and recognizing the name of the farms that supply their proteins. The service at Eleven is exceptional and the food is great. A lot of people seem to have a problem with Big Burrito but I think they are wholly responsible for a lot of the fine dining scene in Pittsburgh. Mad Mex, as laid back and casual as it is, is a great way to introduce your palette to flavors that will lead you to bigger and much more challenging flavors. Eleven is Big Burrito's attempt at the prize at the end of that journey and I think for most people, it's sufficient.

However, when the same manager came by 10 min later and looked the the full glass in front of me with an empty glass next to it - he looked to my coworker and asked ""Sir, is that your drink and you need another or is that hers and she is done with it?"" I did not realize that in 2014 a manager for customer service would find it necessary to not address a woman directly. Offended doesn't even begin to explain my outrage. Unfortunately, I said nothing at the time - although I should have. But I will never return to be treated so poorly or to patronize an establishment managed by such a blatantly sexist male.",13,13,12,Negative

There were several empty tables surrounding us but we were told we couldn't take them because they were reserved for other people as they expected to be busy due to the pirate game. This was odd to me because we were paying customers and they were making us stand when there were empty tables available?

Okay... 5 stars on the accomodating staff. Friendly. Flexible. We started with a group of 6...wait...sorry 8...wait...sorry...10 people for a friend's birthday party and the staff just kept finding ways to get us seating. It is NOT their fault that the seating we ended up with was apparently a repurposed shoebox in the ass end of the top floor of the restaurant. That was not on them. I don't know what that space normally does...but it did hold 10. And the restaurant was steadily busy all night. So full marks there. We started out the evening on the ground floor. We ordered drinks from the menu. They were good. I don't...I don't REALLY remember what they were. I'll look them up. Bear with me. RIGHT! Okay...I got the Delicioso. House Margarita, muddled jalapeno & cucumber + splash of soda...right up my alley. It was really good. I probably would have ordered another one later except I thought it would be smarter to order a pitcher instead. Related note...it is almost impossible for a single father of a younger daughter to order the Delicioso without doing so using an impression of Backpack from Dora the Explorer. The pitcher I got was the Kahlo - Hornitos Reposado, club soda, fresh lime juice, fresh mint. I should take a minute here to acknowledge that written underneath the margarita menu (in too small a font, if we're being fair) was, ""Keep in mind, silver tequila (used in many of our signature cocktails and margaritas) can sneak up on you. The smooth flavor doesn't taste like alcohol, but we assure you, it's in there!"" Heed this. The drinks were great. Let's give them another five stars. The speed with which our order was taken was a downer. I'd rank it pretty low, honestly, but they were so good about moving us around, and also...I had a pitcher of alcohol...so I wasn't really THAT irritated by it, but if I'd have been sober longer I might have been. They were busy. We were a big...seemingly nomadic table...so I have to give them a pass. I'll rate that 3 stars. I've sampled most of the elevated taco joints in Pittsburgh, so I was excited to try out theirs. They have either a build your own menu, or a few signature styles. I was surprised how many vegan\/vegetarian options there were. I think one of the three I got was vegetarian. I was...I was quite drunk when the food arrived. BUT...BUT...they were goooooood. And that's not the tequila talking. After my first taco, the girl across the table from me said she couldn't finish hers and passed it across and that one was even better than the one I'd ordered. The Mantis: Sweet Lucy shell, jackfruit, onions, tomato, Chihuahua cheese, and mango habañero sauce. Honestly ordered it because I wanted to say ""jackfruit"" over and over. What? I was drunk. George's Dirty Taco: Flour soft shell, queso blanco, rice, black beans, onions and dirty sauce This one just made me laugh. I was eating George's dirty taco. And laughing. Because I'm twelve. And I was drunk. Surf 'n' Turf: Flour soft shell, queso fresco, rice, ghost pepper steak, shrimp ceviche, lettuce, onions, roja salsa, & dirty sauce This one sounded the best to me, and I honestly don't remember whether I even ate it. I think I did though. And it was hot. I poured myself another drink from the pitcher. All in all I have no idea which tacos I ate and didn't eat. And I think the fact that I put my name on the order slip (they give you pencils and taco order forms at the table) as Rico Caliente probably contributed to the chaos that forced one of our party to just pay for the entire night on his credit card. And I guess...I guess arms raised in victory and shouting ""WOOHOO!"" was not the correct reaction to this because everyone else seemed to be saying things like, ""Oh my god, no, you can't possibly"" and ""It's too much"" and stuff like that and frankly I was just happy to still have enough money to go to the next place, and also I was drunk. So...I will DEFINITELY be back. Something I didn't mention was the decor. I loved it. Lots of contrasting sugar skull-esque sorts of murals. It was a fun vibe. GREAT happy hour locale.

We could see empty tables around and more that were being cleaned so we hoped it wouldn't be long. 8:30pm comes around and we were still waiting.

Isaac Holeva from Faded\/premiere innovations is always raving about it and I'll say I appreciate his enthusiasm about good eats. My fiancé and I went this evening arriving about 15 minutes early for our 6:30 reservations (not needed place only had five tables sat) and were immediately a little put off. There were two girls behind the bar with a deer in headlights look... after a little deliberation between the two one decided she would seat us, but only after going to talk to one of her tables. So we waited awkwardly for several minutes before she came over to seat us. We choose our own table in the dining room, as apparently that was the norm, and aside from one hideous piece of art it was quite nice. High ceilings, murals of fish on the walls and some tables were actually accented with fish bowls. After sitting for ten minutes without so much as a greeting, and without menus I might add(she claimed to have no idea where they were??), a waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered the Rodolfo Malbec ($40) and were finally allowed to see the menu offerings. The malbec was a little on the lighter bodied side for me but tasty nonetheless. The waitress returned with our wine about 12 minutes later and poured both glasses without offering a taste or checking to see if it was even the right bottle. Aside from the obvious time dilemma, this is a clear sign of poor training\/management. Regardless, we ordered. My fiancé selected the lobster bisque to share with me and the shrimp and scallops with the lobster buerr blanc preparation. I chose the land and sea pairing of 6oz filet with three jumbo shrimp and a scallop served with smashed redskin potatos and charred asparagus. Another 10 minutes went by before her soup finally arrived. The bisque appeared a little darker than I am accustomed to seeing them and I immediately suspected the rue was burnt. sure enough there was a bitter tone that muddled the flavor of this bisque which did sport some nice meaty chunks. The food arrived about 15 minutes after the soup and I must say this was the highlight of the evening. Everything was cooked perfectly! The lemongrass on the steak was an excellent preparation and the shrimp and scallops were broiled to perfection. There was an obvious fresh quality to everything and I must note the shrimp especially was a little briney as if fresh out of the ocean. The scallops were the best thing on both of our plates! We devoured everything and decided to stay for an after dinner drink. The cocktail selection offered several delicious sound cocktails and we opted for a lemon basil martini. It sounded so good but after waiting for literally 15 minutes while 3 people sat behind the bar doing nothing we decided to simply leave. Overall I would rate the place 6.75 out of 10. The staff was awful and it seemed people appeared out of nowhere to stand around and do nothing. There was no apparent management figure, although I did see luke himself come to 2 tables to deliver food. They need a serious overall in the GM department.

Mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari in that delectable sauce. Call me happy! My hubby ordered the Pad Kra Pow, a basil sauce with chicken and topped with 2 over easy eggs. There was some yummy sampling back and forth with both our dishes. The girls ordered Drunken Noodles and Drunken Fried Rice, both with tofu.

I came across Meat & Potatoes through Yelp, and secured a reservation. Since there were only two of us, we decided to forego the main course and just stick with the mouthwatering appetizers. In order of favorites (tartare and bone marrow may have been tied, to be honest): *Tartare - perfectly boiled egg with solid protein, and runny yolk served on top of a heaping portion of steak tartare. I don't know if it was the egg, the seaweed aioli, or the dry aged steak, but the flavors of this dish just worked! Must have if we return! *Bone Marrow - not one, not two, but FOUR tyrannosaurus rex sized bones! There was toasted bread and an assortment of toppers (sea salt, capers, etc) as well. Needless to say, the two of us didn't finish all 4 bones. *Fried Pickles - thick, half-inch cut circles deep fried perfectly and with great side of spicy ranch. We asked for an additional side of the truffle mayo ($1 charge) for dipping options. *Poutine - probably our least favorite dish, and why this place can't get 5 stars in my book. The flavors overall were good but the fries were overly salted, and the curds were almost non-existent, and the dish really didn't stand up in any way.

Started with pate, which was an ample portion, and the seasonal salad, both hit the spot. Lamb burger was good-sized and excellent. Korean Reuben could have used a little more kimchi since it really did go well with the corn beef, but it was an interesting and enjoyable (and large) sandwich. Couldn't even finish all the french fries served with each sandwich since we wanted dessert. We went with gingerbread cake which was fresh and delicious but we couldn't help thinking it would have been better after 10 seconds in a microwave.

My one compliant is the cheese curds - there isn't enough and their consistency is such that they don't really melt. I had the buffalo two ways - buffalo steak served with buffalo sweet breads. The steak was yummy and fairly light. I usually like sweet breads, but these were maybe too big because they seemed a little too glandular for me to stomach. Plus I wasn't a fan of the buffalo sauce.

After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed. Well as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. The most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate! Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked. So many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. Then our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook. Neither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening.",8,3,3,Negative

When you walk into the Christos, don't expect to be greeted- you won't be (unless someone pulled you in off the street). Plan on walking to the back to find someone who may or may not seat you, or you may be told to sit wherever you want. I would recommend sitting outside, although not your typical ""patio seating"" ambience, it's (in my opinion) the better option. It's teeny tiny and super old school. The menus are old and messy, but you're not eating those anyway, right? So all of that aside, Christos is a really fantastic little family owned authentic Greek place that serves really great food. They serve it slow, but they serve it good! I ordered the hummus and pita bread as an appetizer (yummm) and the Greek Pizza as my meal, and it was so good! I really loved it, and you can't beat the prices. My lunch was all of $12, and I ordered a soft drink, an appetizer, and a pizza that came with a salad... and it was good! The point to me pointing out all of the negatives first was that you can't ignore the obvious and pretend it doesn't exist.. truth is, all that stuff is true. But if you're prepared for it and willing to overlook it, you will leave pleased. Just keep in mind that it is a family owned establishment- there's no advertising, no sponsors, no corporate funding.. don't go in expecting top notch service, or hip decorations.

However, I found that the food here just wasn't that... interesting. I mean, everything tasted perfectly ok, but it seemed to lack any real flavor. The chips and salsa were the one exception: as good as everyone says they are. But the rest of it, I found to be really kind of lacking. The ceviche had these tiny, tiny shrimp that just absolutely had no taste to them, for example. I don't get it; serve me some actual crustaceans and charge me more. The entrees were similarly bland; I had a fish entree and my girlfriend had a sort of pasta-like thing, which was the only thing that actually seemed to have some interesting sauce on it.

The reduction was sweet. TOO sweet for me. I didn't like how it paired with the cheese sauce OR the steak. The steak was cooked just right, but was a little tough, and I had to cut a couple inedible pieces off. I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to not awesome steak, or just my lack of experience with Strip steak vs. Filet.

Primanti Brothers is open 24 hours a day and has a small parking lot attached for customer parking. If you get there after 6pm street parking is open, so you should have several options. The restaurant is a lot of fun to look at. You can tell it has been around for a long time (80 years). The walls are covered in framed newspaper articles reviewing the restaurant, pictures of celebrities at the restaurant, and t-shirts that say ""Bite Me...Primanti Brothers."" They are a cash only facility, but there is an ATM in the front in case you don't have any cash on you. The kitchen is open and you can sit in that room or the attached room where the bar is located. The restaurant can be compared to an old diner or sandwich shop where you can find the menu on a placard on the wall. All but three of the sandwiches are meat heavy. If you are not a meat eater then you may choose one of two fish sandwiches, an egg sandwich, or a cheese sandwich. All sandwiches come with a heaping helping of fries, cole slaw, and tomato piled on top of your sandwich filling choice, and stuffed in between two thick pieces of white bread. I split a cheese deluxe sandwich with my girlfriend. She really enjoyed her half of the sandwich, complimenting the cook for getting the greasiness of the fries just perfect. I was not as pleased with my half. I enjoyed the cole slaw, it added a bit of tang and tart crispness to a rather dull sandwich. They were not at all generous with the amount of cheese in the sandwich, the bread was quite tasteless, and the fries were soggy and flavorless. I added some salt to the fries and that made a world of difference, but I still wasn't a fan.

However, given the ratio of fries (huge) compared to coleslaw and sandwich filling (pastrami & cheese w\/ egg), sometimes it just tasted like a bland french fry sandwich. When the combination in my bite was just right, it was fabulous, but they could work a little more on the ratios so it's not quite so potatoey. Prob wouldn't be such a big deal if the potatoes weren't a little bland (yes, there are tasty potatoes but not in the 20 lb costco bags).

How cool is that? Their food is off the charts great! The Belgian waffle is crispy and perfectly holds its place with the beautifully seasoned and pretty sizable chicken breast pieces. They have maple syrup, sriracha maple syrup and a delectable jalapeño honey as some of the topping\/dipping choices. That jalapeño honey, oh my my what a happy surprise that was. I got the Chick with 2 pieces of chicken and hubby got The Hen with 3 pieces. Last time I got The Chick 'N Waffle with pieces of chicken cooked right inside the waffle. All are incredibly tasty and pure perfection in a styrofoam container - it's a food truck, you need that. Yes, after round 2 I'm definitely upping my rating to 5 stars.

He also stated that he would be changing the wording of the menu that evening, but said ""Confit is a word used in fine dining establishments!"" Fine dining?

It was such a nice light texture, not grainy or chunky in the slightest. Great unusual start to the meal. For an entree I had the chinati braised short rib. This was a venture to me because i never had tried short rib but am a big Osso Buco fan so i figured it was worth a try with the waiters recommendation. He was so right, extremely tender, pot roast like taste but chianti braising was phenomonal. Portion size was a little small and I felt the orzo mac and cheese had a very light taste that didnt do much for the dish. The short rib itself was something I would come back for alone.

I applaud the effort to try something new in Pittsburgh. I understand the concept of the chef incubator. But their claim that you don't need reservations and can easily find a table was not the case on Saturday night. We struggled to find a table for two amid a cacophonous throng. We found ourselves taking off items of apparel just to save a table. The first thing you have to do is find your table. Take off your jacket to save your table, and then step up to the bar to order drinks. You have fight for a place at the bar. You fight for a place at the restaurants. You are spoken to a bit brusquely at the restaurant because they are inundated by orders. This would normally be an activity that would be only witnessed by your server in a traditional restaurant. Then you make your way back to your seat and shoo away people wondering if your table is available. Once your food comes , you wander aimlessly around looking for a clean Fork. The station where in the cutlery and napkins reside is devoid of clean utensils. You can't find a fork. You give up and go to the restaurant and ask someone at the restaurant at which you ordered to find you a fork. Five minutes later, they courteously come with a fork. Sound like a relaxing evening? I sat there and watched women in high heels and evening dress bussing their own tables. To be fair, our food was excellent. We ordered the roasted chicken and the prawns carbonara. I had a lentil salad which was delectable. I have absolutely no argument with the quality of the food. I give the food 4 out of 5 Stars. It was inventive and tasty. It was served in a timely fashion. The beleaguered line cook even brought it out to my table. This brings up another topic. In my past trips to the smallman Galley when purchasing food, there has been a opportunity to tip. It was my belief when I tipped my server that I was tipping for service. Generally, at the Smallman Galley, I am walking up to the register and placing my order. I pay for my order. I go back to my seat. When my order is ready, I get up, get my silverware, and bring the plate back to the table. I am assuming that the payment for the food covers the salary of the employees who work there and that there is no need for tipping. So, in closing, to be fair, you will get an excellent meal. You'll get a very decent drink. But you will pay pretty much what you will pay at a high-end restaurant. For two people with drinks and main course with side, salad, and appetizer we paid about $135 for our evening at Smallman Galley. But I wonder how long it's going to take the throngs of people jamming into the restaurant to figure out that that is what they could pay for an evening out at a nice restaurant and not have to bus their own tables, fight for a spot ordering., look for a fork, fight for a spot at the bar to order a drink, etcetera. Saturday, after a tough work week, should not be a slog and a fight at your favorite restaurant. But all of this is not to say that Smallman Galley does not have its merits. I think the execution just needs some work. If they had servers and Runners and tableside ordering with iPads or other electronic devices, the system would work much better. You wouldn't have to fight for a spot at a restaurant. You wouldn't have to bus your own tables. You wouldn't have to fight for a fork. And the tip that you leave would be truly Justified. This is a good idea. The execution though is horrible and needs work if this business model is to continue. And by the way, don't believe that a seat is a foregone conclusion at this restaurant on a busy night. 4 stars for the food, 0 stars for the experience of dining out to equal an average of 2 Stars.",4,1,1,Negative

It was my birthday...or a few days later. A friend and I were celebrating. Smallman Galley was on my ""list"" to try. I didn't know what to expect. But I think I had in my mind a vision of what this ""chef incubator"" was going to be. Things I didn't expect: picnic table seating, 4 ""store fronts"", people lined up ordering from the counter. So...go into it with that expectation. I kind of love the idea of the place, but if you were thinking to woo your lady love (or man love, whatevs) with a candle-lit dinner in a cozy restaurant with amazing service...well, you'd miss the mark. I had to wait. My friend was late. I was sitting at the bar, so I didn't really care. I perused the menu. First drink that popped out at me was a Primus song. ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver"" reportedly had: Amara Sfumato Rabarbaro, Aperol, Genepy des Alpes, pluot syrup, and La Croix. First impressions: I don't know what any of those things are. Not one. Hadn't heard of them. Hadn't had them. Didn't know how to pronounce them. The only word I recognized was ""syrup"". I vaguely recalled 'des' might have meant ""of"" in friench. Or Belgian. Whatever. Completely incomprehensible drink while you wait for a friend? TAKE ALL MY MONEY! It was really good. Served in a tall glass with a lemon garnish, I sat and drank my fancy unpronouncably ingrediented drink in suave sophistication. I texted a picture to my friend. ""You're there already?"" Yeah...because that's when we said we'd meet. Whatever. I finished that drink and went two lines up on the drink menu. ""Vilified"" This promised brown butter-washed bourbon, sage-sweet potato syrup, and black walnut bitters. So much effort went into this drink. Who do they get to wash the bourbon in brown butter? How many natives died making the sage-sweet potato syrup? And I don't even know how you make a bitter let alone a black walnut bitter. This drink was described so pretentiously I had to lie to the bartender and tell him my name was Thurston J. Howell before he'd pour it for me. It was great. I would have had another. Wait...I did have another. I think. Things were starting to get a little...hazy. It had an orange garnish. It didn't photograph well. I texted a picture of vilified to my friend. ""What? You're on your second drink?"" I was. ""You're going to be hammered by the time I get there."" I was. Whatever. I finished that drink and and moved on to ""Cyco Vision"". Redemption rye, Yellow Chartreuse, pistachio orgeat, lemon, cardamom bitters, egg white. And listen...I'm a sucker for egg whites in my drink. I can't explain why. Rye? Awesome. Yellow Chartreuse? Confusing. Orgeat? Let's be honest. When I got to orgeat it sounded like orgy and I might have chuckled to myself and just ordered the drink because of the orgeat. I don't even know what orgeat is. But...it also reminded me of Xergiok from Adventure Time. I had to have this drink. I had this drink. It was good. It was honestly my least favorite of the three but it was good. I took a picture...it looked like a malt. Served in a wide goblet, It had a thick foam on top and the bartender drew a little design with ...maybe with the orgeat...I don't know. Fancy! I texted my friend the picture. ""Jesus, I'm almost there, slow down!"" I did. And then my friend arrived and I recommended the Vilified and she hated it, so I drank hers and she took the ""Superman"" that I ordered, which was good, but I wasn't in love with it. And then the bartender accidentally made someone another drink and it wasn't what he ordered and so she was going to dump it, but I said, ""What do you do with a drink when it's the wrong one?"" and she said, ""Dump it, unless you want it."" I did. I don't even know what it was. I think it was good. It's not completely clear. And so now...Well now I've had five or six drinks in an hour and a half and I'm pretty much open for business, but it's time to eat, because god forbid we drink on an empty stomach. TOO LATE!! IT WAS TOO LATE!! But I walked past the previously-mentioned store fronts on my way to the bathroom and brought back a few ideas... We ended up eating shrimp and grits (fairly certain this was delicious, but I have no idea which place I got it from) and poutine (again...and again). So...I guess the mixed bag is that 1) I really don't have a clear memory of the food. I know it was good. I just don't know where I got it, but 2) I have a very strong sense of the drink menu. And it was a good drink menu. Go for drinks! I will be back. What I remember of the food was that it was really good. I know what to expect (no waitress, first come first serve seating, picnic table style). Outstanding place to go with a group of friends and just sort of sprawl out across a picnic table and drink and try new foods.",11,17,12,Positive

Third visit here. Always seated fast but takes a long time for waitress to come to table. Based on the menu listing liquor is served by ounces, your typical single or double shot.

When received total bill all drinks were charged at the double shot\/ounce rate of $12. When I asked why, the waitress explained that because the drinks were on the rocks that they had to make it a double. When I explained that I never ordered ice, and that this should've been explained, as the menu makes no reference to the price being based on ice with the drink or not, she agreed that she should've explained when I ordered and offered to have a manager speak with me. The manager explained that the price I was charged was not based on the ice but instead that I did not order a mixer with the drink. He explained that if you order a drink straight you have to get a double. If order a drink with a mixer you have to get a single shot. When I asked him to explain why that is not specified on the menu he agreed that it should be. When I asked if it's not then why aren't servers mandated to explain to customers he acknowledged that they should. At this point I asked if I could be charged the lesser rate for each drink and he stated no. When I explained that their charges on my bill were deceptive and unfair he simply informed me that nothing could be done. I also explained that I ordered the same drink on a previous visit and was charged the single shot rate. He stated he could not change the bill. I had not yet started to drink my last drink so I then asked if he could take it back as I was unwilling to pay for it. He informed me that he could not because it was already poured and now contaminated and they could do nothing with it. At this point I told him that he either had to remove my last drink that I had not started to drink or call the police as I was not going to pay any portion of the bill unless it was removed. He agreed to remove it. I paid the double ounce price for all other drinks even though when I ordered that is not what I ordered.

Additionally, this place is very clean. Even the bathrooms are given considerable attention. The staff is great as well.

Honestly just visited with friends from out-of-town as a lark. I'm allergic to cats and take medication, but I was concerned that an hour inside the upstairs cat loft would stretch pharmaceutical science and my lungs to their limits. It did not. I found the loft to be immaculately clean...precious little cat hair migrated to the furnishings, no smell, no messes...just a bunch of EXTREMELY docile well-groomed kitties. Unlike Dobby, my cat (I hope you're reading this, Dobby), they were all extremely accepting of petting and cuddles and did not tear ass all over the room destroying my furniture for no apparent reason. They seemed very at home in the loft and cavorted happily in and amongst the cat castles strategically interspersed among the more people-suited couches and chairs. You guys...they serve liquor. I ordered their version of a French 75 (some cat-related name derivation or other) and it was delicious. One complaint, and it is minor, is that it wasn't immediately apparent who actually worked there. She had a laptop and I honestly thought she was just some young lady enjoying a stress-easing change of work (or study) venue, sitting on one of the couches, absently petting a cat. Once I realized she worked their, she happily and readily parted with the laptop, took my order and disappeared downstairs to fill it. Service upstairs is necessarily slow. One waitress per 10 people (they limit the loft to 10 at a time) and a trip downstairs then up. Service downstairs I didn't experience, having arrived a bit late and escorting my friends immediately upstairs for our reservation. I'd return. I'd order a drink five or so minutes before my reservation, take it up and then order another after I got there if the spirit moved me. Just more convenient that way.

There are some delicious drinks on there. We made it about four deep in our sampling before cutting our losses, and three out of four were worth returning for in and of themselves. The food was flavorful comfort food with nice portion sizes. We ordered a robata sampler appetizer (marinated grilled meats and vegetables on skewers) that was delicious and more than enough for two as an app. The Da Shoyu Mein entree (ramen \/ pulled pork \/ korean pickled bean sprouts shoda shoyu tare \/ 30 min egg \/ scallions sauteed mushrooms) I ordered cost $12. $12. Server was quick\/attentive\/knowledgeable. Laughed at our jokes. That's important...you know...to me. Didn't cost an arm and a leg.

Put it all together on a piece of the texas style toast served with it and you have a melting genius combination that will leave you salvating. We also really enjoyed their version of Mac & Cheese, the goat cheese was the real standout here. A sharp variation, creamy and surprisingly complex. For Entrees we tried the Wagyu Flank Steak and Seared Scallops. I have to admit I am no scallop fan but found this dish to be the better of the two, they were absolutely perfectly prepared with a fantastic crunch to top them off. The Flank Steak was very good but I did feel like I could of picked a better Entree to represent the restaurants diversity and expertise, I just think I picked the wrong dish, nothing more. I was satisfied but not wowed by this steak, I dont really understand the whole Wagyu craze anyway.I would recommend this restaurant to anybody that liked meat and potatoes and likes to stay some what in American Comfort Food. However this menu is a bit more exotic than M&P. Service was excellent and knowledgeable as well.",1,0,0,Positive

We were going to stay for the rest of the night b\/c we love the cocktails there but he absolutely ruined our moods so we left and went elsewhere. I ended up paying for the meal so his being nice to my date was fruitless for him because, for the first time in my life, I gave well below my standard 30% tip. I normally would not have gone on this rant publicly and figured that, perhaps, he just remembered me those three times and I 'rubbed him the wrong way', but just yesterday my friend told me about a nearly identical experience she had with him.

For our main dishes, we had the roasted chicken - delicious with wild mushrooms, creamed Brussels and grapes - nice combo of sweet and savory flavors. We also had the smoked lamb beck served with feta, spicy greens, beans and chimichurri. If you like lamb, this would be a good dish for you. The meat fell off the bone it was so tender.

We got a super early reservation which was about as good as we could do for literally weeks. The place, however, was less than 1\/2 full (except for the two bars) the entire time we were there (5:20-7:15). Which made me wonder why it's so hard to get a res? Oh, well. Just note this suggests you can pop in after all. The decor is interesting. NYC-hipster-trendy-meets-hunting-lodge? I thought it was interesting. My husband was like, huh? The service was prompt and very pleasant. A definite A plus. Of course the drinks and menu bore comparison to M&P, which we love. This menu seemed bigger and a bit funkier\/less ""accessible"" than M&P. Lots of aps\/small pates, which is a big plus to me. Not too much on the menu for pickier eaters. (Actually, my husband had a limited selection, but I blame him for being picky... doesn't care for tomatoes, pasta and several varieties of cheese... rather limiting.) We both started with manhattans, which were easily on par with the ones at the speakeasy at the william penn. Definitely worth the trip alone. I ordered three apps, because I like to taste things (and don't mind left overs). I had the special greens & beans, brussels and shisihto. The greens & beans were an interesting take and were tasty enough, but nothing overwhelming. The brussels and shishito were delish. I would definitely order them again. Roasted brussels sprouts with dill and lemon aoli and shishito (japanese peppers) with siracha aioli -- yum! My husband ordered the hanger steak feature, which he declared one of the best food compositions, if not the best, he's ever eaten. He just wished there was more of it. (Not a huge portion size and he's a big guy.... he should have ordered a salad...) I also had a sazerac. Expertly crafted. Total bill came to $104, which I thought was pretty reasonably for the quality of the food. Cocktails are $10, which is downright cheap for this sort of place downtown. All in all, we'd definitely go back. Next time, I'd probably just do apps at the bar with cocktails.",0,0,0,Positive

There's a nice balance of foods and everything I have had there has been wonderful. Best brussel sprouts in the burgh, and there's LOTS of competition Pig Candy is a must try. And of course...the rye flight. Staff knows their business. The young woman who waited on my sister and I during our most recent visit impressed me with her knowledge of the menu and the bar, steering us deftly toward options that satisfied our palates and warned us of impending danger (one example: ""they say that one in twelve shishito peppers is really hot, but lately they've been trending a bit hotter"" - in response to my sister's question regarding whether the shishito small plate might be too spicy for her) If there's any downside it's that some of the seating is cramped and shoulder to shoulder with adjacent tables. And it's noisy, which might stand between you and that romantic evening out that you'd planned. If you make reservations far enough in advance, a table of four will get you seated beneath the ""antler chandelier"" where the tables are a bit larger and the elbow room a substantially improved.

The wait staff quickly served us water, asked us for our drinks and we had all five on the table within 5-7 minutes of being seated. Outstanding. The group ordered a variety of foods, including tomato risotto, salads, mac and cheese, the anniversary saucy balls in marina over penne and spaghetti and a meatball sandwich. Drinks ranged from drafts to wine to rum and coke. All were refilled quickly and without being pushed on us. We shared the donuts in chocolate dipping sauce for dessert.

The menu is small (1 page), but theres a lot of variety to choose from. Reluctantly, I ordered the Kaya burger (I'm not really a burger fan and DEFINITELY not a bacon fan) because my friend gave me a couple of her faves and the burger was right on top, so I took her advice and went with that, cooked Med Well, with a side of sweet potato fries, and let me tell you, i ate every. last. bite. it was that good. So kudos to the cooks in the kitchen for making this hater of red meat and bacon clean her plate with no regrets! We also ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was OK.. I mean, we finished it so it wasn't bad, but I've had better (which is the only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.. but I've been told that the other drinks are amazing so maybe there will be a review update in my future). All in all, I really liked Kaya. The theme and the decor was cool I thought, and the service was good. Not fabulous, not horrible.. just your basic good service, and thats ok with me.

Went here a little while back with a friend visiting from out of town. Our overall impression? Non-memorable food, and mildly tacky decor led to a ""meh"" type experience. We started with the chips and mango salsa. This was pretty good; their chips are made in-house and were tasty. My friend enjoyed the salsa more than I did, which could be because I didn't expect the mango-tomatillo to be quite so sweet. Could definitely appreciate their fresh ingredients. Sangria was super-sour. To mitigate this, our server suggested simple syrup, and brought some for us to mix in as we saw fit. Take this as you may. On to entrees: Friend got the jerk pulled pork quesadilla which was soggy and over-stuffed with pork (i.e. the cheese-to-pork ratio was definitely off). Although she consumed far less than half of it, she had no desire to pack the rest, and left it to soak in its own juices a bit further. I ordered the chicken breast with confit enchiladas. While the chicken was good, it wasn't anything I'd make a special trip for again. The confit enchiladas, however, were memorable - in a bad way. They were over-cooked, tasting like re-microwaved taquitos. Not even taquitos that were good to begin with, prior to the round 2 reheating. Yikes. The outer shell was also quite oily\/greasy in appearance and in taste. In essence, could have done without the enchiladas. The barstools with hanging faux leather palm tree leaves gave my friend the sense that were in a cheap Caribbean hotel's lobby. Yikes again. Maybe a bit harsh, but Kaya, you just weren't my fav.",2,2,2,Negative

You get an entire half a chicken fried with old school pasta salad, a vinegary coleslaw and a stack of fresh tortilla straight from Reyna's Foods down the block. We started off with the Yucatan Bean Dip appetizer. If you've ever had the bean dip at Mad Mex you'll recognize it. It's beany, slightly salty and a little spicy. Very flavorful. I have to say, the chicken is a little steep at 15 dollars a plate but I thought it was amazing. The chicken was delicious and browned nicely and the ranch-style dip they give you is a really good with accompaniment. I love being able to pick apart the chicken and put it in the tortilla and make myself a little taco. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so blending southern cuisine with the containment system of a Mexican tortilla is great. I hate coleslaw, especially mayo-based. If it is a vinegar based slaw I tend to like it a wee bit more. The coleslaw I had at Kaya was so good I ate all of it. It had little bits of pepper in it, a huge vinegary kick and a spiciness that I think came from ginger. The pasta salad was like what your grandma would make. The chef at Kaya really must like the sourness of vinegar, however, because it's really evident in this dish as well. Luckily, I love that in food. I could see a lot of people being overwhelmed by it. The only complaint was when my girlfriend ordered a Mojito. When it came I took a sip and thought it was pretty bad. It mostly tasted like alcohol and the ripped mint floating inside overwhelmed it to the point where you couldn't taste the mint anymore so much as the leafy flavor underneath. I did not care for it at all. I definitely want to check out what Kaya has on their actual menu. I'll be back.",1,0,0,Positive

I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed... The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease. Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a ""sour cream"" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish. I think the ""sour cream"" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex. Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad. Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine. Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (""what are arepas?""), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that ""sour cream"" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around. So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. ""Strawberry Pound Cake"" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)! The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute. To quote Kaya's website, ""The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible."" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of ""American"" flavor with very little suggestion of ""island"" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define ""American"" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves ""fusion"" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal. The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator. The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion.

This place has got to buy there salt in bulk bc they are heavy handed with the stuff. We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty\/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime. They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it. The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend. I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words. The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious. I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates. The drinks were solid and i would recommend the margarita's. Solid place to have a drink and the decor was also modern and cool.

I gotta say, they might be small but they sure are good. I got the Pollo Rojo and Pork Belly tacos. Both were good but the Pork Belly tacos stood out, they nailed it. $4 a taco..not the best price but these aren't your run-of-the mill tacos. Added Chips and Guac for $7, LOADS of guac with avocado chunks throughout. Most places skip on the guacamole, but for $7 you get an impressive amount. I think I'll keep this place in mind for when I'm looking for a quick bite or want to munch on some chips and grab a beer with friends. Much the same as my last review, the staff are super nice.

The fish was fresh and at a nice temperature, and the rice was well cooked and seasoned.

My brother took our families to Morton's last night and we were seated in a private room. My husband and I arrived first and we told our waitress to please put all of the drinks on a separate bill which we would pay. She said this would not be a problem. Everyone else arrived and we proceeded to order drinks and food. Everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks. As we were finishing, I suddenly noticed our waitress had given the bills to my brother. (We were seated at opposite ends of the table.). I got her attention and asked for the bill for the drinks. She said my brother had already paid both bills. I told her that we had said we wanted the bill for the drinks. She shrugged her shoulders and said, ""Sorry, I got confused."" Then she left. My brother wouldn't let us reimburse him and I didn't want to make a fuss at the restaurant. HOWEVER- this is not the type of service I expect to receive at a top restaurant. No attempt was made to correct the error. I was angry at the mistake and angrier at her cavalier attitude.

My boyfriend and I attended Morton's this evening to take advantage of restaurant week. I'm not sure if restaurant week had something to do with the sub par food. If so, its a shame because you would think the restaurant would want to feature their bests. We both ordered the Morton salad with egg, anchovies, and blue cheese and we both agreed that the salads had too much dressing. For the main course, he ordered the 16 once bone in pork chop and I ordered the 6 ounce filet. He definitely went with the better option. The pork was flavorful and delicious. The filet was undercooked, I ordered it medium and it was medium rare. Good flavor, but honestly not better than any filet I've prepared at home. The sides left much to be desired. I ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes. We had to send the potatoes back because they were cold. The broccoli and the potatoes were very bland not much flavor at all, and there was certainly a lack of presentation. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse and he had the key lime pie. The pie was probably the best thing about the whole experience, that and the onion bread. In hindsight, I'm glad we didn't pay full price and I'd much rather have eaten at Ruth Chris or any of the other restaurants participating in restaurant week. For the price, it wasn't bad given the amount of food, but I expected more from Morton's. Don't believe I will be returning here unless it's free!",2,1,0,Negative

A group of ten of us went for $1 Happy Hour Oysters. All told, our group ordered 12 dozen, but at the end of the evening, we were charged for 16 dozen. That's nearly $50 worth of oysters we didn't eat. The restaurant was hosting a private wedding reception on the newer half, so the place was very crowded and chaotic. Our waitress was visibly stressed out from the moment we walked in. She was visibly shaking the entire evening. Each of us ordered our oysters at the counter separately, but she decided to maintain one ""record"" on a couple of post-it notes. It was a struggle to even get the oysters we ordered because she was very confused. As we each paid, we tipped her geneously because we could tell she was having a hard time. Yet, after each of us paid, she insisted we still owed for four dozen. Those of us that had gotten oysters approached the counter to clear up the misunderstanding. She explained that she wrote down how many dozen we ordered as we ordered them, then crossed them off as we paid for them. Each of us recounted how many we had ordered and how many we had paid for, and some of us provided receipts to show we had paid. This wasn't sufficient for our waitress, as she insisted she was right. It was insulting. The items she crossed off were illegible so there was no way to evidence where she had made a mistake. We ended up having to pay for the oysters we didn't eat. She made comments like, ""We've been doing this for 10 years."" That's swell, but your record system is archaic at best, and you are a mess right now. She complained that she didn't want ""to break the check up"" in the first place. The check shouldn't have needed broken up because we ordered separately. She should have given each person a separate post-it with their name on it. She overcomplicated the bill and then held us responsible for it. It was infuriating. All in all, we won't​ be returning. Ever. It was my favorite spot for Happy Hour Oysters but I will find a new one. I've rarely been so insulted while dining out, especially by someone who refuses to accept they made a mistake when their only evidence is that they didn't scratch out something on a post-it note. We are ten honest professionals trying to have a nice night out. This was a disaster, and Penn Avenue Fish Company was responsible.",6,1,0,Negative

It's not often that you come across an indoor fish market selling the most exquisite varieties of fish and other seafood, and also housing a cool and casual looking restaurant with an interesting seafood inspired menu. I was really looking forward to eating here, but the experience was far from anything I was hoping for. Sitting in the midst of a fresh fish market, I had high expectations about the quality of seafood I would be served. The high yelp ratings only fueled my expectations further. I ordered a lobster roll sandwich on a pretzel bun, and my husband went with the Smoked salmon Benedict. Maybe, I just ordered the wrong thing...I now see that most yelpers have not enjoyed their lobster sandwiches a lot, wish I had read the reviews earlier. Well, to their credit, the food did come out pretty fast. The smoked salmon benedict looked nice and my husband seemed to enjoy it. But the lobster sandwich was quite a disgrace. Did I mention that I love lobsters? I found it hard to believe that someone could go wrong with lobster rolls\/sandwiches. All you need is some good lobster meat and bread, maybe a dollop of butter as an added bonus. The lobster meat itself wasn't probably bad in this sandwich, but you could hardly taste it because it was mixed with other things. And if you want to serve a lobster-slaw kind of filling instead of pure lobster meat, you should probably add some spices and seasoning to it, at least some salt for starters. The dry, over-toasted pretzel bun with no butter\/cheese\/mayo\/mustard did not help either. The side of fresh fruit was probably the only redeeming feature of this meal. Such a letdown! Please do not go for the lobster roll here, even if you love lobsters as much as I do. I'm sure the other things on their menu are much better..I myself would like to try their sushis based on all the great reviews.",1,0,0,Negative

The srircha sauce that it advertised was actually a mixture of the sauce with sour cream. I think it went well with the tacos. I also got a bowl of clam chowder soup that was very tasty. The stock was thinner than I'm use to but still as flavorful. It was a little light on clams, though and had a lot of potato.

I had the salmon eggs benedict and my girlfriend had the lemon pancakes with blueberries. The food was good, and I was pleasantly surprised when the my benedict came with not just potatoes but also a small salad. But after eating, we were treated to more odd, poor service. While we were waiting for the check, our server came to the table but then walked away before actually saying anything. It was just weird. And about the check - at $15(!) for the benedict and $11 for pancakes, it was noticeably more expensive than other comparable restaurants. In summary, I think Bizarre Marco is tragically hip.

The first thing I noticed entering the Brillo Box was its unique decor. Dim lighting, old school Merry Melodies cartoons playing on the TVs, and strange unrelated relics and trinkets displayed behind the bar kept me mesmerized. It's sensory overload, but by all means I don't mean that in a negative way. I felt like I was in some strange world far away from Pittsburgh. I usually find this sort of funky decor to be a distraction and a gimmick, but in the case of the Brillo Box it works. One complaint I'd heard before my review was that Brillo Box was a hipster-only scene. Though there was a good number of people that one may classify as hipsters, everyone I met while drinking at the downstairs bar was friendly and extremely welcoming. To be honest, Brillo Box might be the friendliest bar I've been to in Pittsburgh. Within five minutes of sitting down with a pint of Dale's Pale Ale in my hand a group at the corner of the bar had already struck up a conversation with me. Furthermore, the bartenders are cordial too. They have in-depth knowledge of the beers they sell (a good number of micro-brews) and never hesitated from striking up conversations with the patrons. One bartender even gave me two of their latest micro brew drafts and put it on the bars tab. The prices here are pretty expensive for Pittsburgh standards (I live in San Francisco now and the brillobox would be considered cheap here). I chose from the plethora of draft beers and each was around $5. The man sitting next to me was drinking Patron Margaritas (4 Shots) for $16.50 a pop. The cheapest beers on special that night was Straub and Miller Lite bottles for around $3. As I was sitting at the downstairs bar I kept hearing talk about a DJ and dance party going on upstairs. Now I don't really like to dance (probably because I really suck at it) so I usually stay away from the DJ dance party scene, but since I was here for a review I thought I might as well head up and check it out. I'm glad I did because it really was a pleasant surprise. After paying the $4 cover, which was pretty bush-league for Pittsburgh (great deal in SF), I entered to see that the place was really bumping for a Thursday night. The dance floor was pretty good size along with a small bar near the back for dancers to re-fuel. The DJ was set up on the stage in front beneath a large projection screen showing intriguing videos somehow related to the music playing. Mind you, by that time I was pretty ripped so I have a hard time remembering if the videos were actual music videos or something else. The DJ was mixing rap with indie rock and a whole bunch of other genres I wasn't really familiar with but everyone else seemed to know. Even upstairs on the dance floor, Brillo Box's friendly atmosphere shined on. I was merely satisfied to stand at the side and watch everyone else dance around making fools of themselves, but a group of young ladies pulled me out to the dance floor and after much pleading finally got me to dance. And the best part of it was they only laughed a little at how bad I was. I ended up really enjoying the time I spent reviewing the Brillo Box, so much in fact that I will definitely be back. The friendliness of the patrons and staff mixed with a good beer selection gets great marks in my book. The decor might be a little over the top, but it really was a nice change of pace and something you don't see every day in the Pittsburgh bar scene.",1,0,0,Positive

We tried the mcbrillo burger and to my surprise it didn't come with fries. Fries are extra. $6 extra. Your side choices are broccoli, chips and salsa or something else that I normally wouldn't have as a side with a burger. I chose chips and salsa. Not even good chips and salsa. The burger itself was good, tasted really fresh but nothing special. Nothing really stood out to me. I don't know if they didn't put enough sauce on it or what but I wouldn't pay $12 for it again. I was thrown off by the poor seating. There's bar seating, the booths are great for groups, but theres a few TINY round tables for two people, they're so small and in the most awkward place, it just feels like everyone walking by is on top of you. Even the waiter kept having to move out of the way for people walking by while he was taking our order. I wanted to ask if we could move to a booth that just cleared up but didn't want to be rude if a group walked in. Basically this place is crowded in my opinion. That brings me to the service... they kinda just float around. They aren't really attentive. I had to flag them down. Not sure if I would return.",0,0,0,Negative

I got the tortellini with pesto and my mother got the gnocchi with red pepper sauce. The pesto was more like an Alfredo sauce with pesto in it. Although not what I expected, it was amazing. The red pepper sauce was sweet and tangy, a little different but still very enjoyable. All of the courses came out quickly- we were there for less than an hour.

You know...so the vegans know how to find you. And...bear with me here...that makes sense. But Apteka isn't a good vegan restaurant. Or...perhaps it's more accurate to say instead, Apteka isn't JUST a good VEGAN restaurant. It's a good restaurant. Yeah...there's no meat on the menu. Or...you know...dairy or eggs or fish and stuff. So I suppose if you're dining with someone that REQUIRES meat. Like...like Count Dracula for example. If you and the Count are dining, this is a bad selection. But apart from Count Dracula, or other people...like those too hidebound to attempt something with the ""Vegan"" label...this is a good restaurant. No additional qualifiers required. Secondly...I sampled four cocktails from their bar. All from the menu (before you think, ugh, Jesus, Jim, not another drunk review...one of the drinks was just a taste of my date's drink). And they were each better than the last. REALLY well balanced nicely thought out drinks. Can't really go wrong. The pierogies were excellent. The tartines were superb. The Boczniaki z kapusta was good, not great...the cabbage was a little clunky to eat. It resisted my efforts to cut it into mouthful sized pieces. The flavors were nice though. We capped our evening with the ""special sandwich"". We just saw it pass our table too many times not to give it a try. It didn't disappoint. Our server was a menacing looking fellow all betatted and armful with a perpetual scowl. Which sounds like a bad thing, but if you asked him a question he would just light up like a kid at christmas and tell you ALL THE THINGS, beaming and gushing and very knowledgable and the contrast was so friggin' delightful that I kept asking him stuff to watch him transform over and over from menacing to kid-at-christmas and back again. Probably the biggest criticism I have to the place is that it's lit in a way that is not conducive to artful pictures. You know we MUST have pictures of our food. And no matter which way we positioned glasses or seats or plates...there was always some weird shadow. Work on it, Apteka. The people must post. Anyway...I'll be back.

Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice.

Let me also say that I initially decided to rate the restaurant with 5 stars. The first time I came here, I ordered the pate as a first course and the chicken as a second course. One really has to try the dirty bread pudding accompaniment to believe how good it is. The second time I came I again enjoyed the pate so much that I got it again but this time enjoyed the pork tenderloin. The third time I returned, I know it shows a real lack of imagination, but I had to get the pate again. This time, however I had the poached cod. Unbelievable! I have to say that the food is beautifully prepared. The Manhattans that we had with dinner were some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh, comparing very nicely to Butcher and the Rye which I place at the top. I do notice a subtle change in the attitude of the restaurant, however. This time, when we went, we were told by our waitress that we could no longer place our order for a first course, enjoy our drinks, and then place our order for our entree after relaxing over the pate. We were told that everything had to be placed at once. Now I get it, small kitchen. It's just that there's been a bit of a shift from a friendly atmosphere - to one where the emphasis seems to be less on the patron and more on the needs of the kitchen. Still, I guess they know what they need to get the job done. Fair enough. When it was time to have dessert and coffee, we ordered dessert and each had a coffee. Again choosing to relax over coffee each desiring a cup and then a second cup we were told that $4 each for coffee ($8) buys you one cup each. If you'd like another cup, well, you don't get another cup. Go ahead and buy another cup. $16 for two cups each of coffee does not seem reasonable. To be fair, we still enjoyed our meal. The meal was expertly prepared. The only problem is that we felt that $143 for 2 should entitle you to relax over dessert and a couple of cups of coffee for a few minutes. We left feeling unloved.

The portion is 'American' and the burger was really thick and as juicy as I expected done medium. As with any BIG burgers I like to cut it in half so it's manageable...and so I can still seem somewhat ladylike. The first half of the burger was OK\/good\/no complaints. The second half just seemed to lack flavor... I guess during the first half I was just hungry, but when you calm down and taste the order, it was so bland. I mean of course I could taste the mayo\/ketchup\/mustard, but the actual meat part was just flavorless. I was really disappointed by that...

The outside is a bit unassuming, every time I go by their curtains are drawn so it's hard to get a feel for the business. However, once you come inside you'll find that it's warm and inviting. The food is amazing and aromatic, how I think Indian food should be. I opted for their lamb tandoori, intentionally deviated from the too familiar curry. It came out on a sizzling cast-iron skillet and was full of flavor. The vegetables were nice and crunchy and the lamb had a bright red color that looked beautiful. The service was impeccable and attentive. I especially loved the breath freshener at the end of a meal; your bill comes with a whole handful of fennel, annis and huge salt crystals to freshen your breath.

Now, I will be a tad sentimental here. Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai. A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since. And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher. We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food! Over the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC. To be honest, it is not much to look at. It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot. But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little ""diner"". Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :) We have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had. Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh. BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :) I think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter. Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for. DH will scrape the bowl on this one. I am a noodle junkie. My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew. I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful. It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places. TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing. I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish. I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can't find comparable anywhere else. I will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.

After dining here once, I couldn't wait to go back. The 2nd time has me pining for a 3rd. I ate every dribble of sauce off my last dish there and snapped a photo of my friend licking her plate! Yep, THAT GOOD! It's tough not to order off the wall chalkboard menu but I did get the starter pork belly lettuce wraps last time from the actual menu. My husband shushed me because I apparently made a bit too much of an enthusiastic sound as I took my first bite. My fingers were sticky by the time I was done and I didn't care. I did share 1 with hubby and I believe he made a similar noise as what I did & I also remember him saying 'wow!' Pork belly cooked & sauced to absolute perfection. My chalkboard dinner entree was veal medallions with roasted root veggies, spinach & black truffle hollandaise that I didn't leave a single speck of on my plate. The veal was super tender and a really nicely sized portion, the sauce to die for! Service was fabulous on both of our visits. Reservations are always required here with some advance notice to get what you want. You must call because they aren't on Open Table. The restaurant is small and usually packed but there's still enough room between diners that you don't hear their conversations. They are also BYOB and the person taking our reservation even reminded us of that. Can't wait to go back!!!!",7,1,6,Positive

So in effect I'm rating them not on an absolute scale but relative to what they try to be. I'll say right off the bat that I was very underwhelmed by Avenue B. It was hyped to me by some friends and the fact that it was a pain to get a reservation for this place for a Friday night made me think that it was worth the hype. Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. I came here with my girlfriend, and as appetizers we got the tartare and the mussels. The tartare was perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole meal: entirely bland with almost no dressing. There was a sort of slight smoky flavor to the meat tartare (there was also a salmon tartare as well) but otherwise it was pretty tasteless (the salmon wasn't any better). The mussels were very small, though the sauce was pretty decent. I found it mostly unexceptional, though my girlfriend liked it, but for the same price you can get a much better dish at either Point Brugge or Brasserie 33. For the mains I had the hanger steak and she had the monkfish. I am not terribly familiar with monkfish so I don't know what the ""right"" way to prepare it is, but when I tried a piece, it was rather flavorless. My girlfriend thought that it was tougher than it should have been and that the taste of the fish was watered down by the sauce. It seems to me that when you have a fish that is not naturally full of flavor, you have to prepare a sauce for it that enhances it, but it didn't seem to me like that was the case with that dish. The hanger steak was fine, and the lobster mac and cheese was a nice touch, but again, there wasn't anything particularly special about it. The meat was of decent quality and prepared nicely, but overall I found it less juicy and flavorful than the hanger steaks I had at Salt and Meat & Potatoes. We also had a side dish of brussels sprouts to share, which I thought were ok, if a little too well done and too drenched with sauce. The only really good part of the meal was the dessert. We split the chocolate salt bar with the olive oil ice cream, which was very nice. Overall, we both felt that Avenue B was overrated relative to other good restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's not that anything was bad per se, but if you're interested in getting a good meal in the 412, there are any number of restaurants that you could go to that would cost you the same amount but have much better quality of food. Just to list a few: Salt, Meat & Potatoes, and Legume, all of which have a comparable style of food, are much better and not more expensive. In addition, all those places have great cocktails, whereas Avenue B is BYOB; nothing wrong with that, but it's not like I'm going to be mixing a bourbon drink at my table. You could do worse than eat here, but you could also do a lot better.",0,0,0,Negative

The tuna^3 (tuna sashimi, tuna tartare on rice, and tuna and roe nigiri) was an ambitious take on the Japanese classic. The tuna tartare was amazing. While the sashimi had a unique and delicious seasoning, the quality of fish was not stellar (but probably typical for a landlocked city like Pittsburgh). The sushi rice was not appropriately cooked (seemed a bit dry\/undercooked). But I laud the chef for the innovative adaptation of the dish. The cauliflower soup was standard and was pretty tasty. The wagyu meatloaf was excellent. Avenue B has managed to let the taste of high quality beef shine through the meatloaf in ways far better than expected. The fried onions were light and crispy and the mashed potatoes were good too. The dessert was alright. A white chocolate ice cream filled with crunchy things. The berries or whatever inside were kind of acidic. According to my friends who ordered the John Dory and prawns, and the pork chop, they were also fantastic. The free bread was okay.

I avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. Last night, I tried the ""Sizzling Sensation"" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the ""Taro Bowl A-La-King."" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or ""weight watchers"" items. That goes for just about anywhere! Delivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly.",3,0,0,Negative

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. It was actually pretty good. It consisted of a good variety of fish, including (if I remember correctly) lean tuna, fatty tuna, farmed Atlantic salmon, octopus, snapper. While these pieces of sashimi are not particularly outstanding, they are not too bad for a budget sushi restaurant (unlike the unfresh stuff found in certain other Pittsburgh sushi restaurants). The egg and the crab sticks were welcome additions too. I'd give it four stars for the quality of the chirashi, but then numerous fruit flies and sticky stains on the tables warrant the subtraction of another star.",0,0,0,Negative

The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town. Once I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time! The drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here. The atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new). Our last server was really slow about checking on us and drinks took a long time (though it wasn't busy). And as with most Big Burrito restaurants, I don't like that there are separate food runners from servers, because it makes it confusing and more time consuming to ask for things. I prefer the bar seating and service, usually. All in all, I think Soba is Pittsburgh's best place to eat and drink.",2,0,1,Positive

The inside is great, I was especially fond of the two story waterfall against one wall. The seats were comfortable and the pace of the service let you know that you could stick around a while and enjoy yourself. The food isn't as Asian as I expected it but still delicious. I went with the filet mignon and it melted in my mouth like butter. The sprouts on top gave it a nice, fresh crunch. The service was spectacular, as it should be for this type of establishment. My only real complaint is that after having been to Kaya and Eleven, I feel Soba could diversify their menu a bit. A few of their dishes can be found on its brother's menus and I don't think they're quite capturing Eastern food. Either way, it's delicious.",1,0,2,Positive

It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out. At first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine. However once we placed our drinks it took the staff, I kid you not 25 minutes to make and bring 4 drinks. They would have never been brought if the manager didnt approach the table and ask if everything was ok. After he finally brought them with the time in mind he did comp our round which was a nice gesture. The appetizers, which mind you were brought out BEFORE the drinks, without any staff paying attention that fact. Apps were the best part of the meal. Korean BBQ Ribs, were dry and really needed the extra bbq sauce to make the rib succulent and still the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. The Rock Shrimp was excellent, very light batter, fantastic lightly spicy sauce and spiced well. same shrimp as Umi. The Softshell crab was pretty good, the heirloom tomatoes and avocado added a nice touch and the crab was prepared perfectly, soft and a good crisp crunch. What really hurt this experience were the entrees. I had ordered the Double Cut Pork Chop and ordered it cooked t o the chefs suggestion in preparation when it came out, it was a tough pork chop, noticeable without even cutting into it. I dealt with it and continued to eat it but overall a tough and dry dish. The accompaniments such as snap peas, lotus root and mushrooms just seemed very thrown together, and didnt add anything to the taste of the dish, did not mesh well. My friend ordered the Roasted Chicken which was a variation of a chicken ramen soup. For $22 a ramen entree should be out of this world and it was far from that, and it was work to get the dish into ready condition to be consumed. The girls ordered shareable sushi offerings and found them to be just ok nothing greater than they have had at good sushi restaurants. The service was lacking all around our meal. Apparently it was ""Jam on Walnut St Festival"" which meant that many checked out the soba bar for drinks. However when I went to the restroom and passed by it looked like a normal bar scene to me. Not only did our beverages take 25 minutes to arrive. The waiter never checked up on us after app or entree until we were obviously ready for the table to cleared and when I was served my pork chop I still was left with a butterknife to cut this tough piece of meat. Had to ask server for a steak knife, which was clearly meant to be served with this dish. When the girls got their shareable entrees the dumpings they ordered were replaced by shittake mushroom dumplings when they ordered shrimp. The ambience of the restaurant is nice but some of our party had trouble seeing as it is extremely dim all around making it tough to read and even see your dish. There was a lot of cell phones out at tables around us for flash light usage. I wouldn't return to Soba it just does not offer enough for me to justify the cost and it looks like right now they are having trouble serving dinner on a saturday night.",2,0,0,Negative

When we asked for our checks, she brought out one check despite requesting separate checks. We tried to make it easy by sectioning off the check and writing our credit card numbers and cash amounts next to each order, yet she still charged over half of our orders to the wrong cards, and the orders that were charged contained the incorrect individual items. She failed to bring change back for anyone who paid with cash, and then gave us attitude when we asked for change. We spoke to a manager, who tried to lie to us and tell us that it was written on the menu that parties over 6 people would not have split checks. We checked the menu, and the only fine print said that parties with over 6 people would have 18% gratuity included on their checks.

Easy choice -- buttery shrimp and grits. Spectacular. Most of us took advantage of the bloody Mary bar -- extensive list of goodies to add, several different mixes (and spice levels) to serve as bases and a long list of vodkas -- including a few they'd infused on their own -- make the bloody bar a mandatory stop on a Sunday morning.

In the summer it's often Seafood Phad Cha and I'm always delighted to see that because its my favorite one ever - the sauce is amazing! Their sauces are always so flavorful with lots of fresh veggies & delicious fresh seafood like shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, tilapia and often some crazy corkscrew looking piece of seafood that I can't identify but thoroughly enjoy! Recently the special was Chili Mango Seafood which had a slightly sweeter sauce with the addition of the fresh mango. You can order your preference of heat from 1-10, and I always go 6 - I enjoy a good kick! Since 2 of our family members are vegetarian, we've probably ordered every vegetarian appetizer they offer over the years and they are all delightful.

Being that NTK had made the top 25 restaurants in the burgh, i had to try it. So we made a rez and headed over. Let's start by saying it is in an interesting neighborhood. They are rehabbing lots of houses so there is some other activity on the street. But it is a teenie tiny little house converted to a restaurant. When you enter, you will look at those front steps and think ""it's not too late to turn around"" - but ignore the cracked steps and keep going. Then you enter the house and walk down a long hallway when you think ""i should have turned around at the steps"" but keep walking. When they seat you, you immediately realize that you are in a tiny little dining room and it is rather cozy. And then - the menu comes. Wow. Just wow. Yeah, they have pad thai. and they have curry. and they have rad na noodles. and then they have lots of other choices - vegetarian, thai-hesitant (for those who don't like thai or are fearful of thai), and just some really really cool dishes. So here goes the rundown of what was ordered. The appetizer dog choice was the fresh spring rolls. So how do you differentiate yourself from the competition? Slice them into manageable chunks so that they can be shared easily and dipped into that Yummy dipping sauce. I start with me as I can't rave enough about what I had. Phar Luck Chicken. it was a plate of steamed veggies (gr beans, snow peas, broccoli) covered with rice noodles, chicken breasts that were lightly spiced, then a peanut sauce on top. I ordered a level 5 not knowing how it would be as one restaurant's 5 is another one's 3or 7. Veggies were nicely steamed and crisp. The chicken was mildly spiced atop a bed of noodles. And finished with a medium spiced peanut sauce. Just enough to taste but not over soaked. And the surprise? Two shrimps and some lump crabmeat. Ok chef - one comment here. I loved the seafood but I know not everyone can eat that so including something that can trigger an allergic reaction without disclosing it can lead to disaster. And no customer would ever assume to ask about shrimp in a chicken dish. Maybe add it to the description or have waitstaff mention it when it is ordered? DH had green curry with chicken. Lots of veggies, nicely spiced but nothing out of the ordinary. It was good but maybe not as strong of a curry taste as he was used to. But it held its own with the other Thai restaurants. DSS had crab pineapple fried rice. Ok. Seriously. How could you not love that combo. It took self-restraint on my part to not just grab that plate from him. Now THAT was an unusual combo I have never seen elsewhere and according to DSS, it was great (first sign of a good dish? No offers to share :) Our server was excellent. Never was a water glass empty. plates were removed promptly. We were never rushed as we lingered in conversation. So this is now added to my ""places to visit when back in the burgh"" list. 7\/16. Update. I decided while back in the burgh again on business to revisit NTK. I ordered takeout to nibble back at the hotel. A few comments. 1. The Phar Luck was as good as I remembered. Yum again 2. I passed on an appetizer so I could Try their sticky rice with custard. Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered black sticky rice....oh my....wow. Topped with a square of creamy smooth custard topped with coconut. Again the little details that make NTK just stand out from the pack. 3. I was surprised to be charged a surcharge for a takeout order. Seriously? Each item was marked up for the privilege of saving them the salary they pay their waitstaff when I took the food out. No, it is not a big deal (a little over 10% or so). Again, disclosure would have been nice. Or no surcharge at all. 4. Speaking of takeout, chef, how about using some of that surcharge to pay for decent plastic ware? I don't do chopsticks and found that it was impossible to spear the steamed veggies with those dollar store forks. Since I was in a hotel without a kitchen, that was the only fork I had and when it snapped in the broccoli....well....let's just say it wasn't pretty. So maybe think about some decent flatware, so I don't need to pack my own next time I get takeout?",2,0,0,Positive

But it wasn't even that good. (Side note: why is the el camp's on McKnight so vastly superior to the other locations?) It was just bland as heck and the service, while pleasant, was really slow. Despite the place being empty. Prices were what you'd expect. On the upside, portions were huge if you're into that type of thing. Of the three of us who went together, the best thing had was a chicken quesadilla... not a good sign. For this type of a joint, I definitely prefer El Paso over in Bridgeville.

The inside is a little classier and more comfortable than others I've been to, and we liked that (although they did have Christmas music playing and some mistletoe hung.. in March lol). The prices are a little higher but not unreasonable. The service was decent but slow. I don't think I've ever waited for sushi as long as I did here.. it was kind of ridiculous! What I ordered was good, but not the best. My husband said he liked it more so than others we've had, so maybe it's just my taste, but I prefer the sushi I've had elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, it WAS good, just not my favorite. We went all out- appetizer (bacon wrapped scallops.. sounds amazing right?? It was mediocre, at best) and desert, and we spent more than we normally do when we go out for sushi, and honestly I'd rather spend less and go elsewhere.

I can't speak for the hibachi side of the restaurant but the food on the other side could be greatly improved along with the service. The sushi is presented nicely and isn't bad, but it isn't anything exceptional considering all of the competition that's now around the area. The miso was bland and just ok and the bento box was a bit expensive for the quality and taste. I would not order either one again. Service is very slow and pretty poor, even when the restaurant is not busy. Unfortunately you will be saddled with an 18% gratuity that is automatically added to your bill whether you feel it is appropriate or not for the service quality. The pros of this place are the parking is easy, it is in a convenient location, and the ambiance inside is great! You can get a decent sushi roll here.

One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh since moving here 8 months ago. Were we seated quickly and had out drink orders taken. We sat in a booth which was next to another booth. The seat had no stability so every time anyone on either side of the connected seat moved it pushed back or forth. I had two fat adults on the other side of me so it was very frustrating. So, we got our drinks and we sat. We waited, and waited, and waited. Others came in, were sat, given drinks, and we watched as their orders were taken. FINALLY our server arrived and just said ""You guys ready?"". No apology for having us wait 20 minutes (estimated). He didn't seem to care that much. Our sushi came fairly quickly. The rolls were average in taste, but very small. We finished them pretty quickly and were still hungry. After our food came our waiter filled our drinks but never returned to see how everything was. Glad i didn't want to order more or needed some side sauce or something. During our dinner I noticed rubbish under our table from a previous party..wonderful.

I forget what he told us his title was but he got us to sign up for there emails and he did a really good job suggesting different drinks and helping us out. At first we were a little confused because he brought the first beer sample to our table and we assumed he was the bartender because he asked us if we wanted to try something else, and when he brought THAT sample, we told him which we preferred and he told us we had to tell our server, which we didnt understand at first, but then he continued to tell us what his job was there. OK, but maybe still just go tell our server.. it just made for a confusing, awkward 30 seconds or so. Regardless, we finally got it and he was a really nice, helpful guy.

So, the food. First let me say that, I'm pretty sure that if everyone in the area stopped ordering pizza from this location, it wouldnt matter because we are basically keeping them in business. I mean, we order here a lot..... a lot.. like, at least 2 or 3 times a month. We're remodeling our home and both working full time, so there are a lot of nights that we forget about dinner until we're both basically starving, and neither of us have the drive to cook or clean, so guess what, pizza it is! And I'm so not ashamed. Anyway, we dont always order the same thing, but whatever we order is always good. We get exactly what we ordered and always in a timely manner. Our pizza is always hot and fresh, and when you're reliving your college diet and pizza is your main source of ""nutrition"", that's really appreciated! So there's that. (4 stars rather than 5 because, c'mon, it is just pizza). Now, on to the staff. I don't want to generalize because I'm sure they're not ALL a bunch of unprofessional, vulgar, ill mannered people, but, the majority of them actually are. I've had quite a few experiences there with the staff being loud and rude, but my most recent really topped them all, which is what prompted me to finally write this review. I ordered carry out online, and when I got there, there were 4 or 5 employees standing outside of the door being pretty obnoxious (loud, rude, swearing, etc), but I ignored them and walked by. From the counter, you have a clear view to the doors and out to the parking lot, and while I was paying, the one girl (I've heard her introduce herself as a supervisor before, not sure if that's true) was facing the building with both middle fingers in the air, yelling ""F*CK this place!""....... now, I understand that sometimes you have bad days, and there are times when you're just fed up with your job for whatever reason, but, show a little professionalism and respect, and control yourself.

We ordered the pretzels to start with, and they were alright, the cheese was slightly below room temperature, which wasn't that appetizing. I personally orderd the hog heaven sandwich. I was tasty, but extremely greasy, leaving one of the slices of bread completely soggy. My Boyfriend ordered the drunken turkey sandwich, which he was not impressed with.

The cheese had great consistency and flavor but after a few bites I had to push the cheese aside and just go for the greens. Decent sized bowl for just over a buck. The pizza - I admit, freaking good. While the crust was thin and had good doughy consistency, the sauce and cheese stole the show. I started with the purist plain cheese before digging into a second slice of pepperoni and mushrooms. My only thing might be that the crust gets a bit soggy towards the end. We got a bowl of sauce on the side and you noticed how sweet it was when not cooked into the pie. I already know I've never had any pizza like this in California, so why not 5 Stars?

The signs for burgers shakes and fries on the bright red awnings are painted over with black. The interior is definitely malt shop chic, an asian fusion restaurant possessing the body of a burger joint, still, they make it work...the shake counter is now a sushi bar. There are some growing pains it would seem. When I walked in it took what felt like an awkwardly long time for the young man behind the register to glance up at me from what he was working on (phone?). It may have only been 30 seconds, but when you're standing in front of someone who doesn't look up, it seems like forever. The place was relatively empty. The booths lining the walls were filled but the interior tables were vacant. He surprised me when he seated me by saying he wanted to place me at a table by the window so he wouldn't forget about me. He gave me the menu...and then appeared to forget about me. I overheard him telling nearly every customer thank you for your patience, but it honestly didn't take long once I'd placed my order to get my food. They must have been short staffed, he returned to tell me that the sushi chef was helping in the kitchen so it would be a few more minutes until I got my Arizona rolls, but my shrimp pad thai arrived relatively quickly. They brought my sushi out...but it was someone else's. They then brought the right order and it was delicious. So ultimately...the pad thai was good. The sushi rolls were good. They did that thing that I hate where they left the tails on the shrimp so I had to pick them up with my fingers to remove the tails, but I couldn't tell if it was on purpose. There were probably six or so shrimp and maybe three of them had tails on and three did not. So either they're inconsistent in their preparation, or they leave the tails on...either way, room for improvement. The taste of all of my food was really good. When I got up to pay my bill the server again apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience, noting that...as I could see...everyone came all at once. But...it was still just as half full as it had been when I showed up. Whatever the reason for the apologies and waits and incorrect orders, they were all minor issues. The food was good. The price was reasonable. The ""wait"" was not long. I think maybe just a little inexperience on the part of the staff and possibly a no-show in the kitchen.

It looked like it had easy enough access for me, so I decided to check it out. I was craving a healthy-but-salty (oxymoron, right?) salad but changed my mind when I checked out the menu. It's an average sized place with a counter that you walk up to and order from. You pay, sit, and they bring your food to you. It is BYO which is nice but not traditional as the place doesn't really seem to ""fit"" a BYO restaurant in the vibe or menu (it's a deli essentially). I ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese because it had an entire section on the menu for it so I figured it would be good. I also ordered the Motmot wrap which had turkey, bacon, some tomato aioli. I also got a foundtain drink. It ended up at about $15 which seemed a little high for a lunch. The service was quick which is nice for a workday lunch. The (side order) of mac and cheese? It was really good and could be a meal in itself. The bowl was put under a broiler to make it a little crispy. The noodles were slightly overcooked which I do not prefer in mac and cheese but the star of the dish was, of course, the cheese. Thick cheese sauce that I knew was hearty after three bites. Very cheddary--not too sharp. It was more like a glue than a sauce. The wrap came with chips and was served warm which I was not expecting. Too much aioli--this is common at restaurants anywhere, but I don't think a sandwhich needs to be dripping in dressing, especially since this was nothing special. The turkey was nice and thinly sliced. The bacon felt more like bacon bits than chopped bacon or even slices of bacon. The turkey was fresh. I only had a few chips. I couldn't tell if they were house made or otherwise. I went back after my three bites of mac and cheese for more. Outside of the noodles being overcooked, that dish is really something special. I would go back to try something else, just not a wrap because I think for the cost it's lacking in execution and flavor.",1,0,1,Negative

I imagined it to be a full sit-down restaurant for some reason so I was a little surprised when it turned out to be more of a smaller casual type of place. You order your food at the counter and they bring it out to you. I got the Italian Beef sandwich which was Italian seasoned beef with hot peppers and provolone on a hoagie roll. To go with it I ordered some onion rings as well. My girlfriend got the tomato pepper jack soup, a meatball sandwich and a side of their homemade potato chips. The Italian beef wasn't like what you'd get in Chicago and would probably be pure blasphemy over there but I liked it. It was a simple sandwich but the ingredients went well together. My only gripe was I wished the beef was cut thinner and had some juice with it. It wasn't dry but when I think of Italian beef I think of heavily seasoned, thin meat that is swimming in its own au jus. The onion rings were really good. The batter they used was the cripsy kind rather than that soggy grainy kind you sometimes see. They epitomized the texture and flavor of a good onion ring. They were browned with a good crunch to them and the onion in the middle was cooked thoroughly and didn't slide out like a worm (this almost makes me gag when it happens with badly prepared rings, it's such a terrible mental image). Janey thought the meatball sandwich was just average. She likes her meatballs seasoned and she said they didn't have a lot of flavor, just ground beef. She liked it but she wasn't blown away by it. The chips were really good, though. Whoever fries in the kitchen knows what they're doing. The soup was creamy and spicy and really good. It was more peppery than tomato which is why I liked it. I'm not a tomato person so tomato soup has never been one of my favorites. Janey really enjoyed the soup and even though she's not much of a sandwich eater thought we should come back again and try more of the menu. The interior of Stoke's is very nice and is clean.

The pizza is not fantastic. I've had it on several occasions. It's decent, but nothing to write home about, but the Omnivore. . . that IS something to write home about, and the letter would read something like this: Dear Mom, I just had the most amazing sandwich of my life. It had bacon and hot peppers, eggs and onion rings, cappicola and steak, cheese. . . and and. . . more stuff! I ate the whole thing because it was too yummy to stop. I am now in intensive care after going into cardiac arrest from eating the damn thing, but it was WORTH it. If you and Dad decide to get one, you should split it, but if you don't, leave the house to me, my sister will just trash it. Love, Jim Something like that. Bottom line, you can buy one of these sandwiches and cut it into quarters and feed four people. Can't recommend the pizza (it's fair. . .) but definitely try the sandwiches. Take out only. . . there's a table or two there, but mostly just for people to wait in the AC-less Mercury-like atmosphere while they finish your food.

What are you trying to do here? You know you can make money by freshly preparing food and letting the actual ingredients show through? Places like this are literally a disrespect to the human race. When you eat at a place like this, you tell restaurant boards that you enjoy having your food microwaved so it comes out fast and piping hot, that you'd rather taste massive amounts of seasonings, mainly salt, than actually taste the food, and that you'd much rather have something wrapped in grease and batter that is bite size and can be crammed in your mouth in quick succession.

Most recently, we made reservations for New Year's Eve for 3 people for 7PM. We arrived about 10 minutes early and still had to wait till about 7:15 before we were seated. During our wait, we sat at an open table near the bar where we proceeded to order a couple drinks. However, the beers listed on the chalkboard menu on the wall weren't up to date. So the server had to keep running back and forth to the bar to verify the available drafts. We finally got to our table and ordered. Although our food showed up in a timely manner, the ""fresh"" veggies were mush and the food was accompanied by gnats. They were flying all over the place, landing on the table, on the wall, my boyfriend spent half the time swatting them away...but it was tough to gain the attention of our server as she was immersed in what must have been a very interesting conversation with a customer nearby. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager reduced our bill. They couldn't move us due to the fact that all the tables had scheduled reservations. Finally, when we had our food boxed up since we didn't want to eat with the gnats, they boxed up and gave us some of the wrong food....it was just comical at that point. Our visit prior to New Year's Eve happened on a late afternoon on a weekend. We seated ourselves at a booth near the bar. It took almost 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us! Even though there were servers in the area and walking past us multiple times, there was not acknowledgment. When our server finally appeared, she reeked of cigarette smoke...to the point that it was just offensive!

What did both my husband & I get at Burgatory? Average burgers, nothing exciting and seriously lacking in flavor with a side of chips that could have chipped a tooth.

Both sounded like they should have had flavor for days. I detected no jerk seasoning whatsoever on my chicken burger - which is actually ground chicken, not a chicken breast which was explained by our server before I ordered. The grilled pineapple was the only flavorful item on the bun, but unfortunately 1\/2 of it was the hard inside core that you can't bite through. The whole wheat bun also started falling apart on my first bite and I didn't know there was banana ketchup on it until I reread the menu description afterward. If I had ordered an actual burger would I feel differently? I tasted my husbands burger and other than the meat itself, it was equally flavorless. He was in total agreement. His was served with an enormous mound of onion straws that try as we might we couldn't find any onions, just fried squiggles of batter. We went there for lunch, so we didn't try the shakes.

Pleasantly, but still surprised. For the area, we certainly weren't expecting such a high end menu, which could be pretty shocking to someone who is craving that typical pub menu (and prices). Fortunately we went in with no expectations or cravings. We sat on the patio which I loved. Nestled right on top of the hillside, the view isnt spectacular (the golden mile isn't exactly what I'd consider scenic), but its still really nice and a relaxing atmosphere. The menu is small, but well rounded with plenty of options for all kinds of different appetites. I'm thinking maybe it changes periodically, because the other reviews I read mentioned some dishes that I didn't see while we were there. I ordered the white sangria for my starter drink, which I expected to be somewhat sweeter, but still tasty. For my dinner, I had the Pannadelle, a perfectly portioned pasta dish with tomatoes, cauliflower, tossed in an oil based sauce.. surprisingly light, yet filling. Sometimes when you order pasta at restaurants you end up feeling overly stuffed and sluggish, but this wasn't that way at all (and it's vegetarian friendly!). My husband had the mussels that were tossed in a pesto sauce and served with bread.. they looked really good, but sadly I'm allergic to mussels so you'll just have to accept my husbands word and bowl of empty shells this time. For dessert I had the creme Brule which was small, but so good.. the perfect size to compliment the end of any meal. Our service was decent. Not horrible but we weren't overly impressed. I feel like when servers see a young couple, they automatically assume we're cheap or just ""don't know"".. we both spent 6 plus years bartending and waiting tables, so we're not cheap and we do know, and we tip based on service, not expectation. So when we get mediocre service, you get a mediocre tip. Anyway, I'm digressing.. We enjoyed ourselves a lot, and we'll definitely go back for round 2.

Caveat: This is takeout-related only. I have dined in the restaurant and had a few good experiences. Like...3-4 star versus the 2 I'm adding. But it's been a while. Okay, so the thing is this: I love pad thai. So I order it a lot. There was a time when I worked at a previous location where I would literally order pad thai at minimum once per week. I've ordered it here at least four times. It's been consistent, which I guess can be considered a good trait. But consistently bad, which I suppose isn't. Today's experience, like the past experiences was characterized by the following (in order of decreasing importance): dry food, attention to detail, and tail-on shrimp. The food seems like it's been overheated (all four experiences). Or heated too long. With takeout, I understand that once you prepare the food you need to keep it warm, but in this case, I arrived before my food was ready (though it was difficult to tell if that was genuinely the case since the servers were slammed. Was it ready and sitting because there was nobody to bring it out? Or was it still being prepared?) and got the same thing. Dry over cooked food...which...inexplicably...was cool to taste. The shrimp was borderline cold. Regarding attention to detail, they were super busy today, so maybe they got hasty and forgot the lime. Personally, I love the taste of a little lime juice squeezed over shrimp pad thai before I eat it. And I recall getting it in the past...just not this time. Regarding tail-on shrimp...Okay maybe it's just me. And it's certainly not restricted to my experience with Papaya versus...any Italian place or steak place or anywhere else that they serve shrimp with pasta or my meal. The tails were on. With a dish where you're expected to pick up the shrimp to eat it (friend shrimp\/shrimp cocktail\/grilled shrimp) that makes sense. But in a pasta or noodle dish it means digging into your sauce-covered dish and employing the ""grip-it-and-rip-it"" technique so you get all the meat. Yeah, I guess you could cut it (though my takeout bag did not include a knife) but then you lose some of the tail, which bugs me. And I've heard people say...""it's about presentation...it makes the dish more attractive""....no. No it doesn't. It's the tail of a insectile animal...it does not beautify or enhance the dish. The ray of sunshine is the hot and sour soup, which has been amazing everytime I've had it. I'll go back, but only because it's the closest pad thai in town. And I'm lazy. But not so lazy that I'd leave the tails on my shrimp pad thai.",0,2,0,Negative

I was in the mood for Thai food but mixed it up a bit. The restaurant sits atop ""The Point"" near Robinson Town Center right of 376 in a strip mall. However, I found the inside to have a nice modern, somewhat upscale atmosphere and I couldn't argue with the ""Fine Asian Cuisine"" marketing on the front window. Service was excellent (although it should be considering there were only 3 tables seated as of 730 PM -- that should have set off an alarm). Unfortunately, my accolades stop there. The prices are high compared to competitors like Thai Foon in the nearby Giant Eagle Market District, but I was willing to overlook that for the right food and setting. I started with a classic Wonton soup, but this was anything but classic. They must've forgot the salt, chicken or both in the broth. It was terribly bland with only a subtle hint of cilantro that has no business in any wonton soup variant. Next I had some fried dumplings. While they weren't terrible, they weren't exceptional either. All 5 of them looked nearly identical, giving away that this ""fine dining"" restaurant uses pre-packaged dumplings. A real disappointment. For my entrée I had a Thai classic, Pad See Ew, which is typically a dish comprised of wide noodles, a choice of meat, broccoli, bean sprouts and eggs, in a brown sauce. Papaya's rendition of thin noodles looked more like a Cantonese style lo mein, but hey a noodle is a noodle I suppose. Their offering was with broccoli and carrots (??? bizarre), so I had the chef add bean sprouts and napa cabbage to help it out. Unfortunately, the ""dark sauce"" was nothing more than a half bottle of soy sauce which overpowered the dish to the point of wondering whether I might suffer middle-of-the-night kidney failure. Bottom line, this Pad See Ew had an emphasis on the Ew. My bill of $27.15 for the above and a small white rice (not included with the meal) was, in hindsight, mind boggling for this poor showing of food. I don't see this place staying in business much longer. For those who gave this a high rating, please let me treat you to some quality Thai food in P'Burgh.",1,1,0,Negative

I went with the wagyu beef, crusted in peppercorns, with spicy ketchup, red onion, and dill served on the standard brioche. I wanted to keep it pretty simple for my first time. I also upgraded to the fries. Glad I did, they were fresh cut, and fried perfectly. The burger was great, although I think I accidentally ordered it well done. Definitely order it medium or rare. Even so, it was still pretty juicy. The bun was soft but stable. It didn't break or mush up under the pressure. I washed it all down with a chocolate shake.

I'm not sure if they make them ahead or not. They just taste like they did. Finally...the fortune cookie. It's never NOT been stale.

I always stop in the Robinson Mall area after leaving the airport and before going to the airport to grab a quick bite. This week was the first time I stopped into Firehouse Subs. As a sandwich aficionado I knew there would be some ""kitschy"" thing they used to try to differentiate them from every other sandwich shop. In this case, it was the firehouse decor - very nice assortment of hoses, firemen apparel, lights, etc. I was hoping that there was more than just decor that made the differentiation. My hopes were realized when I ordered the New York Steamer. The brisket and pastrami were as good as any New York deli - very tender and flavorful. The addition of melted provolone with mayo, mustard and Italian dressing made the sandwich extremely creamy and delicious. I felt it was definitely calorie worthy. Because Firehouse Subs is a chain I will most assuredly start frequently the three locations nearest my home. Another benefit is that the firehouse decor is more than just a ""kitschy"" collection. The company actually was started by a firefighter and provides assistance to firefighters.

The fresh chips and House-made salsa is always waiting for us as soon as we sit down! Also, their salsa is delicious! It's not as chunky and has sort of a lime hint to it - it's just so original. I typically order the shrimp fajitas (I believe) and it comes with all the fix-ins on a sizzling dish of cheese - veggies, refried beans, lettuce, shrimp (obviously) and a handful of warm and fresh tortillas. Now, I'm not a bean person whatsoever, but I could eat an entire plate of El Camp's refried beans! They're more on the sweet side and don't have a weird texture! This time around, I was craving a smothered burrito and boy, did I make a great choice! I ordered the Burritos Tipicos, which is 2 burritos in a warm torilla with shredded beef, refried beans (YAS), topped with lettuce and guacamole (no, it's no extra here!), swimming in a puddle of nacho cheese (not the kind you buy from the grocery store, I promise). LISTEN, it sounds like a mess, but it'll go above and beyond your expectations. And most importantly, the food is not pricey for what you get. Two burritos are about $10, while fajitas and other dishes are closer to $15-$20. But again, they make sure you get your moneys worth!",1,0,1,Positive

I wasn't sure what to expect until I opened the door and was greeted by Yong and sat down at a ""bar"" area that overlooked her small kitchen. The seating is limited and I think she likes it that way. Everything is literally made to order and most orders are called in, whereupon Yong gives you a time frame (depending on the queue) and you pick your food up accordingly. We decided to dine in and sat at the bar and talked to Yong while she prepared our meal and while we ate. She's incredibly personable and truly has captured something special in such an unassuming place. I had short ribs and my girlfriend had the vegetarian ramen, both were of course great. Along with our food she cooked a few side items and had us try them and everything was delicious. Eating at the Golden Pig is like having your mom cook you a warm, tasty, and healthy meal.

She was very consumed with whatever she was doing or figuring out, and it wasn't until someone else (maybe a manager) came to the host stand and asked her if she had greeted us.. because she obviously hadnt.. that she acted totally surprised to see us and finally noticed us. Because this was totally different than what we experienced last time, we tried not to hold it against her too much, but we were still annoyed and we hadn't even been seated yet. She asked us if we'd prefer a small table in the bar area or to sit at the ""Chef's Bar"", I think it was called (or something like that).. she explained to us that that particular area was really fun and that people loved sitting there because of the interaction and liveliness of it, so we agreed and decided to give it a try. We were really confused because no one actually seemed to be our server, even though she gave us the name of someone, and people were just rushing by us busy doing their thing - grabbing food, refilling drinks, etc.. we felt kind of invisible and it was a little awkward. So we were finally greeted by someone who did inform us that he was not our server but would get our drinks, so we ordered and waited some more. Eventually we did finally make contact with someone who claimed to be our server, but I think it may just be rotation based and I got the feeling that this particular seating arrangement was sort of an annoyance to whoever was up in the rotation. Turns out it wasn't fun or exciting.. no one engaged in any conversation with us and our POV was cooks, a food expediter, and the hustle and bustle of what other restaurants would hide behind walls in a closed kitchen.. we could see right into the dishwashing area, the dining area and rest of the restaurant was to our backs, and we were the only 2 sitting at this bar area.. it was a little uncomfortable. I was really unimpressed with this set up and regretting not choosing the small bar table. The only redeeming quality was that our server from last time happened to be doing some of her side work while we were sitting there and so we struck up conversation with her for a couple of minutes, but that was really it. I didn't base my star rating on that experience, because I honestly believe that Juniper Grill is a great place and our first visit was nothing like our second.. it was just an unfortunate chain of events for us. Lesson learned, always choose the ""small table in the bar area!"" :)",0,0,1,Positive
