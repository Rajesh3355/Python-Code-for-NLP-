I was headed to a local lunch spot downtown earlier than usual due to a 12:30 meeting (12:30? seriously?) and this was the first place we found that was serving lunch to the 1st lunch period crowd (remember those poor kids in elementary school that pulled the short straw and ate lunch at 11 AM - that was us that day). Now I am not a drinker. My dog imbibes more than I do, so the beer list was kind of lost on me (besides, I always think it is bad mojo to go into a meeting after lunch and wreak of anything, especially alcohol). My CW and I were the first to be seated - maybe that was our mistake. She ordered the quiche of the day and I ordered a sirloin burger w\/ sweet potato fries. Her salad was okay. Nice greens although not much else going on in it. From there, it went straight downhill. When CW's quiche arrived, it was lovely to look at - leeks and andouille sausage - and cold. Not warm, not cooler than you would prefer. It was flipping cold. So she explained that to the waiter who took it back. Then she waited and waited and waited. Expecting it to be nuked, this was taking quite a while. When he brought the plate out, it was a new piece of quiche - he explained that when they tried to heat up the original piece, it crumbled so they made a new quiche. As a former waitstaff (waitress but trying to be PC here), I would have stayed around and made sure that this piece was more to her liking. But he bolted. And - you guessed - this piece was equally as bad. Now I know - you are going to say she was picky. But I actually touched the quiche to allay my fears and it was flipping cold. My guess? The quiches were either chilled or frozen and they didn't know how to reheat them. She ended up with a 1\/2 of a chicken salad panini with dried cherries although I will be darned if there were any dried cherries in it. So CW is going vote this bistro off the island. My lunch? I ordered the Brew-a-Burger Sirloin rare. When it came, I don't think it was much warmer than CW's quiche - yes, I order it rare and expect the inside to be warm but I also expect the outside to be hot which it wasn't. The cheese sat on the top and never softened, let alone melted. I also expect a rare burger to be flavorful without the addition of much else - and it wasn't. About 1\/2 way through, I almost wondered if they had given me a ground chicken burger in error. At that point, I figured it was not worth pursuing. Should they have given CW a free lunch? Or a GC for a free lunch upon a return visit? Doesn't matter what they should have done as they did nothing - the bill arrived and was paid as expected. All in all, it was not a great food experience. I don't think we will be returning for lunch anytime soon. Was it a bad day for the kitchen? Did we arrive before they were really ready to serve lunch? Not sure but, either way, when you spend $25 plus tip for lunch, I think there are better places to drop it. Pity the kitchen staff cannot live up to the restaurant's name.",2,0,0,Negative

I've visited this P.F. Changs probably 6 times over the past three years. It's usually because there are enough people at work who want to go that we all go. I found something on the menu that I liked and I stuck with it. Prior visits were unspectacular, but once I found ""Dan Dan Noodles"" I was set. At least I was until the visit before my most recent visit. They were bland in an ironic sort of extremely salty way. Do you know what I mean? I mean, it's hard to say that something that tastes like it just came out of a salt shaker is bland, but if that's the ONLY taste it has, then that's what my last order of Dan Dan Noodles tasted like. THIS time, I resolved to find something new to replace Dan Dan Noodles (can you tell I like saying Dan Dan Noodles? Because I do) for future visits. Meh. I'm done with PF Changs, at least lunch and dinner (because I still have a free happy hour dim sum for checking in on Yelp!). I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and found the Kung lacking and also no Pao. What they did NOT leave out, however, was the salt. Holy crap! The waitress (good waitress) gave me a replacement Mr. Pibb, suggesting I'd need it to finish my Kung Pao (presumably because it would be so spicy)...and I did need it. But just to wash down the salt. It was like I ordered a salt lick with a side of ...I'm not sure what...some sort of cold vinegar preparation of sliced vegetables. I was stuck as to whether they were pairing pseudo-kim che with my faux chinese food. Regardless it was not awesome. I'm not kidding when I say the most enjoyable part of the meal was the fried rice, which is not to say that the fried rice was good...it just wasn't as awful as everything else. People like this place, and I don't want my review to sway them away, but it was not good.

Of course it does when you either don't know what your doing or you have more interest in turning a table over than providing a good guest experience.

The signs for burgers shakes and fries on the bright red awnings are painted over with black. The interior is definitely malt shop chic, an asian fusion restaurant possessing the body of a burger joint, still, they make it work...the shake counter is now a sushi bar. There are some growing pains it would seem. When I walked in it took what felt like an awkwardly long time for the young man behind the register to glance up at me from what he was working on (phone?). It may have only been 30 seconds, but when you're standing in front of someone who doesn't look up, it seems like forever. The place was relatively empty. The booths lining the walls were filled but the interior tables were vacant. He surprised me when he seated me by saying he wanted to place me at a table by the window so he wouldn't forget about me. He gave me the menu...and then appeared to forget about me. I overheard him telling nearly every customer thank you for your patience, but it honestly didn't take long once I'd placed my order to get my food. They must have been short staffed, he returned to tell me that the sushi chef was helping in the kitchen so it would be a few more minutes until I got my Arizona rolls, but my shrimp pad thai arrived relatively quickly. They brought my sushi out...but it was someone else's. They then brought the right order and it was delicious. So ultimately...the pad thai was good. The sushi rolls were good. They did that thing that I hate where they left the tails on the shrimp so I had to pick them up with my fingers to remove the tails, but I couldn't tell if it was on purpose. There were probably six or so shrimp and maybe three of them had tails on and three did not. So either they're inconsistent in their preparation, or they leave the tails on...either way, room for improvement. The taste of all of my food was really good. When I got up to pay my bill the server again apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience, noting that...as I could see...everyone came all at once. But...it was still just as half full as it had been when I showed up. Whatever the reason for the apologies and waits and incorrect orders, they were all minor issues. The food was good. The price was reasonable. The ""wait"" was not long. I think maybe just a little inexperience on the part of the staff and possibly a no-show in the kitchen.

I've had the Chicken Tacos, the Chicken Burrito, Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Quesadilla. Someone on here calls it modern Mexican Food, I just call it fancy shmancy and artsy fartsy. No matter what I order it just tastes like it has too much pepper, a little sour and nothing like authentic mexican cuisine. First of all the Salsa sucks. It's just not good at all nor are the chips that go with it. I don't think many people are used to paying $4 or $5 for chips and salsa when they go to a Mexican place. I know I am not. In every other place on the planet It is free and usually arrives almost before you are handed your menus. Last time I went for lunch I tried the Tortilla soup. It had the consistency of a butternut squash soup with zero chicken inside. If I did not read it on the menu and was just handed a cup I would never have guessed what it was. Their Fajitas are painfully average, Not sure if you like paying over $10 for the equivalent of one thinly sliced half chicken breast and some fried peppers and onions. Just seem like less quality than I am used to recieving. The rice is mediocre and usually comes cold on the plate, the black beans have an over bearing peppery taste that I could definately do without. Their roasted red pepper sauce put overtop the Chimichange may be gourmet but it is too sour and tastes like stomach acid. Not really what I would call delicious or even a sought after flavor. I just never got this place. I think it is has more of a draw for people wanting to go drink in a trendy place that is popular with the 20 something dirty panty crowd. In my opinion if you want a good burrito and don't need to have a few drinks before eating it just walk into a Chipotle and pay your $6.50 and be on your way.

I thought it was very plain, not very many chunks of actual artichoke (which made me sad). I ordered the White Pizza (my other choice would have been the one with artichokes... but since we ordered the dip I opted not to). Every other place I have ever had white pizza at has had tomatoes on it. So I was super disappointed when it arrived and there was none. I even asked because I really just assumed it was meant to be on there! Nope... they don't do that. Awkward. It lacked taste for that reason. I wouldn't order it again. (And I know its partly my fault, I should have read menu more thorough... but seriously... NO TOMATOES?) I'll go back, hopefully I'm happier next time.",0,0,0,Negative

Our waitress was new, which I am always extra patient about, but she was rude and simply didn't use common sense. On the way out, another woman approached a server and asked why her food hadn't arrived after 45 minutes, and the server just shrugged. The food was okay, but not great. I had ordered a side of bacon which didn't show up with the meal. When I asked about it, the server told me I wasn't allowed to get that side because someone told her the meal doesn't come with bacon. I said ""but I specifically ordered it as a side.""

In the vast ethnic food-desert that is Pittsburgh, Mediterrano offered REALLY good authentic Greek cuisine, New York good. I told all my friends about it, it was amazing. I remember paying about $40 for my wife and me, and thinking that I would have paid double. Fast forward a few years: I went back, and had the most mediocre Greek food...really it was terrible. We were told that the normal chef was sick, and that someone was filling in. Reluctantly, we paid the bill (prices had gone up), and said we would go back when the normal chef returned. Next time, we ordered in. We spent $100, and got what looked like $40 worth of food...and it wasn't great. The food was generally lacking substance and flavor. Most upsettingly, it was a really bad value. A Groupon came up, so we decided to give it another shot. We ordered Gyros, just Gyros: they were very good. They're not the best I've ever had, but definitely solid. I thought perhaps they had figured out whatever was wrong. Tonight, we went again...and this will likely be the last time. The waitress insisted that we had to order 4 entrees to fulfill the Groupon (which it didn't specify), and wouldn't let us use a gift certificate in addition to the Groupon (which is against policy I think). Our bill was $80 before tip. We ordered: Spanikopita ($7): We received 2 soggy little triangles of spanikopita. Still, this was the highlight of the meal...it was all downhill from here. Lamb Gyro and Eggplant Gyro platters ($12 ea): Greek salad was inedibly sour. The french fries were somehow both burned, and cold. The Gyros themselves were fine, not spectacular. Lamb pasta (dinner special, $24): The portion was small and it wasn't very good. The lamb tasted fine, but there wasn't much of it. The past and sauce I could have made better at home. I can't post pictures, but do the posted pictures look like $25 dishes to you?! Brisket Pizza: I've had this one before, it wasn't bad. Tonight, it was burnt and falling apart!

The novelty of the whole place is what must bring people in the door. There was a place in Squirrel Hill a few years back that let you pick your meat and vegetables for a stir fry and they had since closed up and became the Silk Elephant. I couldn't really see a point in tipping a waitress when the setting is very informal and you are basicly doing all the work. They bring you an empty bowl when you sit down and then your rice and drink if you choose to order one. In my opinion if everything were like Chipotle where you get your own drink and no need to tip someone all the better. I guess I am just a cheapskate but when you are eating this kind of food you really don't want to spend that much cash as a whole. If we had a Pei Wei here in Pittsubrgh then there really would not be much need for a place like BD's. I noticed the onions were cut up all half assed where they leave the core at the end in there and don't care that it is all clumped up and stuck together. One of my pet peeves. Not sure what the draw is here getting your food cooked on a dirty grill by a teenager who would rather shoot the breeze than check to see if your food is burning. Watching him turn and chop my food (loosing a few select pieces of meat into the spill well during the process) with what looked like two filthy sword like utensils was not very appetizing at all. I think when someone else came up behind me and he scraped the grill shooting black carcinogenic ash into my stirfry was the final straw that made me not want to go back. I chose a mixture of about 5 different sauces that completely dried up once poured over my food on the grill. I couldn't really tell what it tasted like since it was so dried out and full of black specs of charcoal. If you want something similar and willing to pay the asking price of $9 for lunch, just go to a good Hibachi Grill somewhere where you get a free entertaining show by a real chef.

It was about $15 for all you can eat bowl, I believe just one bowl was $13, so for the $2 extra dollars might as well go for it. Skip out on the appetizers, even for half off during happy hour, wasn't anything special. I took a quick peek at the soup & salad bar and it didn't seem to be worth it either, although I believe it's included in the unlimited bowl, not sure about that though. My other suggestion would be to put your veggies in the bowl first and then pile your meat on top. They have it set up so you do the meat first and then veggies, but I feel like unless you got mad skill, you end up not being able to put as many veggies in your dish and then your meal seems like it's missing something. Also, there's a huge selection of sauces and spices.. I kind of felt like it was overwhelming, because there were so many options and not really anything you could sample them with. So if you're not really sure of what you like or want, it was hard to try and figure out what would be good. I know on the menu they tell you some things that you can mix together for a certain taste, but it's not listed by the sauce section anywhere. First time up our griller was pretty good, but the second time the guy was too busy doing tricks that he didn't turn our food enough and it ended up being slightly burnt on the one side. Oh - what I thought was nice, is the waitress suggested that we get the unlimited for $2 and she'd box it up so we could take it home for lunch. So no matter what, you're taking something home. We went around 5, so it wasn't that crowded yet.. around 6 more people started coming and lines were formed at the tables and grill for a small wait (I know there were a lot of complaints about that when I read reviews about the place).

Their French onion soup was alright, which I find to be the unfortunate norm with French onion soup these days. I had the barbecue chicken tortilla and black bean soup (say that five times fast), which was... odd. The texture and flavors weren't very appealing altogether. The entrees (with one exception) were the big disappointment. I will say, firstly, that my mother's Popeye Salad with steak was very good. My father and I both had the ribeye with baked potato and asparagus. The steaks could have been trimmed better, but I expect to cut a ring of fat off of my ribeye anymore when I order it. Both steaks were cooked perfectly, but they had no flavor at all. A little salt and pepper doctored that up instantly. The asparagus suffered from a lack of seasoning as well. And the baked potatoes were undercooked. I took mine home to finish baking later. The worst of it was my girlfriend's breaded chicken dish. The chicken itself was fine (although ""fine"" isn't my preferred adjective for a $20-$30 entree). The pasta underneath it was overcooked, totally unsalted penne sitting in a pool of what looked to be olive oil. The menu listed a ""tomato"" relish which just seemed to be chopped tomatoes and not much else. Dessert, on the other hand, was fantastic. The Italian lemon cake, Reese's peanut butter pie, and chocolate lava cake were delicious. We didn't leave a crumb behind. Service was very good, if just a bit sporadic. Our server offered to replace my soup (I declined optimistically), took the chicken dish off our check, and apologized for what we didn't like. Overall, though, the entrees kind of put a damper on the whole experience, especially at the high price point. I saw a few nice looking sandwiches go by, which are the bulk of their food menu. Maybe stick to those if you eat here. I just can't say I'd recommend it.",2,0,0,Negative

She insisted they could not seat us until everyone in my party arrived which to me seemed to inconvenience them more because we were occupying the lobby and seemed to be in the way.

My reservation was for 8 and by 8:45 we hadn't even put our food order in. I ordered a margarita and 30min later I still hadn't received it so my friend complained to the manager who was walking around.

It took me two times to figure out my feelings on this place. I studied in Japan for a year. While I was there, I prized myself as a bit of a foodie. One of my favorites was okonomiyaki, in particular Hiroshimayaki. Between the two times I went to Teppanyaki Kyoto, I got the Hiroshimayaki and a mixture of their appetizers: takoyaki, crochets, those rice cakes with bacon and gyoza. The appetizers were fine, but the crochets were frozen and not made from scratch. It seems a bit funny to be paying do much for frozen food ... Hiroshimayaki is a Hiroshima's take on okonomiyaki. Rather than mixing the ingredients during preparation, the ingredients are layered with soba or udon noodles and then steamed instead of fried. Ideally, Hiroshimayaki is much lighter in taste than its Osaka cousin. Here the Hiroshimayaki was so heavy it made my stomach ache, and the pork was a little too gristly for my tastes.

This is a long review but worth the read. I am a server and have worked in the industry for years, so it takes a lot for me to write a negative review. We arrived and were seated in a timely manner. At around 8:45 we ordered drinks and our 4 courses from the waitress. She came back a few minutes later and let us know that they were out of 1 of 3 appetizers (the only non-seafood option) and 1 of 3 salads. This was a bit strange since it was a small menu for the night and it was only 8:30! So that was the first red flag. Our waitress was nice but seemed like she wasn't trained properly to handle this kind of situation. No one offered us a different food option and we were basically told you can order from what's there or skip the appetizer and you'll still get charged full price. Next, we ordered a second round of drinks after about 20 minutes and it was a disaster. One of the girls in the party realized she was given the wrong bottle of wine the first time around and notified the waitress about it to bring the right one (she hadn't even drank one full glass of it). Never got it. Half the table ordered from one server and the other half from our server. Some people got drinks, some didn't. I was given the wrong drink and then not brought the correct one for 45 minutes! On a night like New Year's Eve after you've just told us that you're out of a few things on the menu, we should've been able to at least get our drinks quickly. One guy in our party ended up going down to the bar to order them because it took so long. The first course appetizers came out at a normal time but once we finished, the dishes sat on our table the entire time we were there. The salads did not come out until almost 10pm (an hour and a half after we sat down) and we quickly realized they used the same salad for the other two options. One was a bibb lettuce salad and one was a spring salad. Both had mixed greens. I understand if you run out of something to use something else, but the whole point of having three different salads on the menu is that they were supposed to be different. So that was frustrating. We had somewhere else to be and were getting very irritated and hungry. We asked around 1015 where our food was and the waitress came back and said about 20 more minutes. We then made the decision to ask to speak to a manager and let her know our concerns. The lady seemed nice but very flustered at what was going on and didn't really have an answer as to why the service and kitchen were lacking. After talking to her and realizing we weren't getting anywhere, we decided to pay for what we had and just leave. They only made us pay for the alcohol which was nice, and we left our waitress a 20% tip on the $130 in alcohol. Had we stayed, she probably would've had a $1500 bill and gotten over 20%. As a waitress, I probably would have stayed if there had been a little more customer service. We were never offered a round of drinks, or a discount for the appetizers we did not want when they were out of the one, and if they would've made a bit more effort, things may have been different. I know it's a new restaurant, but they were not prepared for the night at all. I would not go back on a busy night ever again.",6,0,0,Negative

I don't think I would have ever discovered it without Yelp. I first sought it out based on reviews a few years ago and I remember thoroughly enjoying a salad on the patio on a fine summer's day. Then, earlier this spring my partner and I stopped by to read the menu - my partner noted the sorta high prices and I noted the total lack of vegan options. Someone from inside popped out to let us know that they weren't yet open for dinner (it was b\/w lunch and dinner time) and asked if we'd like to make a reservation for later, all in a very kind and inviting manner. I mentioned that I was hoping to find something vegan and she assured me that the chef could make something. We passed that time (due to cheap partner), but I knew I would return for some al fresco joy, and earlier this week, I did. I called ahead to make a reservation and to make sure they were really ok with making a vegan entree. When we arrived, the vegan thing was acknowledged by our server and we were seated in the best spot on the patio, next to the cute and oddly gregarious turtles! We were handed some well used paper menus and our cheap sparkling wines were properly chilled\/corked\/stored. From then on, things got awkward. My dining companion, who kept baby talking to the turtles throughout the meal and even feeding them, coerced me into drinking her recently deceased grandmother's favorite cheap sparkling wine (Asti) and we made a toast to this woman I never had the pleasure of meeting. And we were left with crusty menus that which had no apparent vegan selections and waited for the server to, um, maybe, uh mention what they could do. Instead she came to take our order. And I had to explain that since nothing is really vegan on the menu, I needed her to describe what could be made vegan. Uhhhh, the mushroom consomme annnnd a salad...ummm...let me go ask the chef. The chef had an excellent answer, it is a mystery to me as to why he was not consulted earlier. I did try the mushroom consomme to start, which was alright (I would not order it again), and ordered the chef's special with was described as a zucchini stuffed with spiced cous cous. Sounded boring. But as presented, it had a lot going on, I almost feared it had too much going on - tomato sauce, capers, walnuts, basil, golden raisins, cinnamon, bread crumbs...whoa! Was it going to be as clumsy as our service? No! It was well composed and very satisfying to my palate which was maybe only slightly deteriorated from drinking Asti. The chef also sent out some complimentary small bites before our entrees, I imagine because the special dish was expected to take longer than a usual menu item, though it didn't seem like an especially long wait. Awesome gesture, as it proved someone was on their toes. At the end of the meal we had our second most painful conversation with the server, regarding coffee. It should have been a pretty simple exchange, really. I ordered espresso and my friend asked if the coffee was french pressed. Instead of just saying ""no,"" we got some bumbling convoluted answer that left us confused - I was able to gather that no, it was not french press coffee and that either the coffee or espresso (or both?) were from some sort of pod - like maybe a machine that sort of presses a pod...My friend, bewildered, just ordered an espresso, but I had to ask, soooo is the espresso from a pod thingy? Yep...ok, I am sorry but I don't want the espresso, and I joked about drawing the line at imitation ""champagne."" No fun. I tried to be really kind and easy going to make up for being such a damn snob, an inconvenience at every turn, for trying to understand what was being offered. As I watched our server describe the specials to an arriving table, counting the two of them on her fingers as if she was twisting each special off of a finger and squeezing it into her palm, I felt sorry for those others who came to endure her writhing translations. As much as I appreciated my special dish, and service aside, I probably would not put them through the trouble of having me dine again. I don't believe the menu changes very often, definitely not every day as the name suggests, as it didn't seem particularly seasonal (for example, one of their two desserts featured pumpkin which, even though it's none of my business, I thought was weird for late June), nor much, if at all, different from my previous visits, and certainly not freshly printed. Nonplussed? + Cash only (+ as in bring it) + Very pleasant patio for those rare perfect days + ^ With friendly turtles, until turtle soup season (maybe next year) + BYOB + Capable and accommodating kitchen to make up for non-communicative server = Worth trying, especially if you don't have dietary restrictions, you have expendable cash, it's a nice day to spend with turtles and you want to provide your own Asti. Hrm, the nonplussed point system might be my new method of expressing cynical optimism.",6,3,2,Negative

After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed. Well as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. The most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate! Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked. So many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. Then our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook.

It looked like it had easy enough access for me, so I decided to check it out. I was craving a healthy-but-salty (oxymoron, right?) salad but changed my mind when I checked out the menu. It's an average sized place with a counter that you walk up to and order from. You pay, sit, and they bring your food to you. It is BYO which is nice but not traditional as the place doesn't really seem to ""fit"" a BYO restaurant in the vibe or menu (it's a deli essentially). I ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese because it had an entire section on the menu for it so I figured it would be good. I also ordered the Motmot wrap which had turkey, bacon, some tomato aioli. I also got a foundtain drink. It ended up at about $15 which seemed a little high for a lunch. The service was quick which is nice for a workday lunch. The (side order) of mac and cheese? It was really good and could be a meal in itself. The bowl was put under a broiler to make it a little crispy. The noodles were slightly overcooked which I do not prefer in mac and cheese but the star of the dish was, of course, the cheese. Thick cheese sauce that I knew was hearty after three bites. Very cheddary--not too sharp. It was more like a glue than a sauce. The wrap came with chips and was served warm which I was not expecting. Too much aioli--this is common at restaurants anywhere, but I don't think a sandwhich needs to be dripping in dressing, especially since this was nothing special. The turkey was nice and thinly sliced. The bacon felt more like bacon bits than chopped bacon or even slices of bacon. The turkey was fresh. I only had a few chips. I couldn't tell if they were house made or otherwise. I went back after my three bites of mac and cheese for more. Outside of the noodles being overcooked, that dish is really something special. I would go back to try something else, just not a wrap because I think for the cost it's lacking in execution and flavor.",1,0,1,Negative

Without having it from before I still kind of get that vibe. It seems like Mineo's makes some okay pizza but mostly rides on the fame it built up from its past. The store is small but you don't really dilly dally so it looks like you can usually find a spot before your pizza is done. We did. I ordered a large pepperoni and sausage and received a pepperoni and mushroom. My girlfriend hates mushrooms but the place was so busy we didn't feel like ordering a new pizza so she picked them off. The crust is ""okay"". It seems like it's trying to be authentic but was kind of on the dry side. In my opinion a good pizza crust should be crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. The ingredients were top notch. The mushrooms were good quality and so was the pepperoni. The pepperoni had the full flavor of a true pepperoni. Not that spicy greasy mixture you get from the store or from most pizza places. The cheese was really good and was slightly browned which is cooked better than most places but still not ""ideal"". The cheese should just be plain dark in some spots. Pizza should be cooked at high heat so give it the texture it was meant to have. However, it still kicks the butt of most places in the city. The once great Mineo's is still great because it's become almost a cultural landmark of Pittsburgh.

I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed... The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease. Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a ""sour cream"" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish. I think the ""sour cream"" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex. Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad. Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine. Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (""what are arepas?""), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that ""sour cream"" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around. So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. ""Strawberry Pound Cake"" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)! The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute. To quote Kaya's website, ""The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible."" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of ""American"" flavor with very little suggestion of ""island"" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define ""American"" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves ""fusion"" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal. The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator. The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion.

It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out. At first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine. However once we placed our drinks it took the staff, I kid you not 25 minutes to make and bring 4 drinks. They would have never been brought if the manager didnt approach the table and ask if everything was ok. After he finally brought them with the time in mind he did comp our round which was a nice gesture. The appetizers, which mind you were brought out BEFORE the drinks, without any staff paying attention that fact. Apps were the best part of the meal. Korean BBQ Ribs, were dry and really needed the extra bbq sauce to make the rib succulent and still the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. The Rock Shrimp was excellent, very light batter, fantastic lightly spicy sauce and spiced well. same shrimp as Umi. The Softshell crab was pretty good, the heirloom tomatoes and avocado added a nice touch and the crab was prepared perfectly, soft and a good crisp crunch. What really hurt this experience were the entrees. I had ordered the Double Cut Pork Chop and ordered it cooked t o the chefs suggestion in preparation when it came out, it was a tough pork chop, noticeable without even cutting into it. I dealt with it and continued to eat it but overall a tough and dry dish. The accompaniments such as snap peas, lotus root and mushrooms just seemed very thrown together, and didnt add anything to the taste of the dish, did not mesh well. My friend ordered the Roasted Chicken which was a variation of a chicken ramen soup. For $22 a ramen entree should be out of this world and it was far from that, and it was work to get the dish into ready condition to be consumed. The girls ordered shareable sushi offerings and found them to be just ok nothing greater than they have had at good sushi restaurants. The service was lacking all around our meal. Apparently it was ""Jam on Walnut St Festival"" which meant that many checked out the soba bar for drinks. However when I went to the restroom and passed by it looked like a normal bar scene to me. Not only did our beverages take 25 minutes to arrive. The waiter never checked up on us after app or entree until we were obviously ready for the table to cleared and when I was served my pork chop I still was left with a butterknife to cut this tough piece of meat. Had to ask server for a steak knife, which was clearly meant to be served with this dish. When the girls got their shareable entrees the dumpings they ordered were replaced by shittake mushroom dumplings when they ordered shrimp. The ambience of the restaurant is nice but some of our party had trouble seeing as it is extremely dim all around making it tough to read and even see your dish. There was a lot of cell phones out at tables around us for flash light usage.

A group of ten of us went for $1 Happy Hour Oysters. All told, our group ordered 12 dozen, but at the end of the evening, we were charged for 16 dozen. That's nearly $50 worth of oysters we didn't eat. The restaurant was hosting a private wedding reception on the newer half, so the place was very crowded and chaotic. Our waitress was visibly stressed out from the moment we walked in. She was visibly shaking the entire evening. Each of us ordered our oysters at the counter separately, but she decided to maintain one ""record"" on a couple of post-it notes. It was a struggle to even get the oysters we ordered because she was very confused. As we each paid, we tipped her geneously because we could tell she was having a hard time. Yet, after each of us paid, she insisted we still owed for four dozen. Those of us that had gotten oysters approached the counter to clear up the misunderstanding. She explained that she wrote down how many dozen we ordered as we ordered them, then crossed them off as we paid for them. Each of us recounted how many we had ordered and how many we had paid for, and some of us provided receipts to show we had paid. This wasn't sufficient for our waitress, as she insisted she was right. It was insulting. The items she crossed off were illegible so there was no way to evidence where she had made a mistake. We ended up having to pay for the oysters we didn't eat. She made comments like, ""We've been doing this for 10 years."" That's swell, but your record system is archaic at best, and you are a mess right now. She complained that she didn't want ""to break the check up"" in the first place. The check shouldn't have needed broken up because we ordered separately. She should have given each person a separate post-it with their name on it. She overcomplicated the bill and then held us responsible for it. It was infuriating. All in all, we won't​ be returning. Ever.

It's not often that you come across an indoor fish market selling the most exquisite varieties of fish and other seafood, and also housing a cool and casual looking restaurant with an interesting seafood inspired menu. I was really looking forward to eating here, but the experience was far from anything I was hoping for. Sitting in the midst of a fresh fish market, I had high expectations about the quality of seafood I would be served. The high yelp ratings only fueled my expectations further. I ordered a lobster roll sandwich on a pretzel bun, and my husband went with the Smoked salmon Benedict. Maybe, I just ordered the wrong thing...I now see that most yelpers have not enjoyed their lobster sandwiches a lot, wish I had read the reviews earlier. Well, to their credit, the food did come out pretty fast. The smoked salmon benedict looked nice and my husband seemed to enjoy it. But the lobster sandwich was quite a disgrace. Did I mention that I love lobsters? I found it hard to believe that someone could go wrong with lobster rolls\/sandwiches. All you need is some good lobster meat and bread, maybe a dollop of butter as an added bonus. The lobster meat itself wasn't probably bad in this sandwich, but you could hardly taste it because it was mixed with other things. And if you want to serve a lobster-slaw kind of filling instead of pure lobster meat, you should probably add some spices and seasoning to it, at least some salt for starters. The dry, over-toasted pretzel bun with no butter\/cheese\/mayo\/mustard did not help either. The side of fresh fruit was probably the only redeeming feature of this meal. Such a letdown! Please do not go for the lobster roll here, even if you love lobsters as much as I do. I'm sure the other things on their menu are much better..I myself would like to try their sushis based on all the great reviews.",1,0,0,Negative

We asked that they split the fettuccine into two bows as I like alfredo and she wanted marinara and I didn't want to pay another 24.00 for my own sauce. So they bring it out mixed together! They actually have a name for this like we were supposed to know. That would be something for the waitress to educate us one upon the special request. They take it back while we quickly ate the three tiny pieces of veal. So then we wait. Here it comes out and her's was ok but mine was terrible. The sauce, which I was told ""made to spec"", sucked. I had to go home and gargle to get the spoiled milk taste out of mouth. Almost like I had unpasteurized milk straight from the cow. We complained and they took the overpriced salad off.

In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus. Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. ""Buy this stock, its a great investment"" or ""Marry her, it'll work out"". Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like ""eat it, you've had worse"", or ""so what if I'm husband number five?"" Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming ""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"" vibe going on..

Brain: ""We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want"") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread. The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer! The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!""). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind. Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich.

Caveat: This is takeout-related only. I have dined in the restaurant and had a few good experiences. Like...3-4 star versus the 2 I'm adding. But it's been a while. Okay, so the thing is this: I love pad thai. So I order it a lot. There was a time when I worked at a previous location where I would literally order pad thai at minimum once per week. I've ordered it here at least four times. It's been consistent, which I guess can be considered a good trait. But consistently bad, which I suppose isn't. Today's experience, like the past experiences was characterized by the following (in order of decreasing importance): dry food, attention to detail, and tail-on shrimp. The food seems like it's been overheated (all four experiences). Or heated too long. With takeout, I understand that once you prepare the food you need to keep it warm, but in this case, I arrived before my food was ready (though it was difficult to tell if that was genuinely the case since the servers were slammed. Was it ready and sitting because there was nobody to bring it out? Or was it still being prepared?) and got the same thing. Dry over cooked food...which...inexplicably...was cool to taste. The shrimp was borderline cold. Regarding attention to detail, they were super busy today, so maybe they got hasty and forgot the lime. Personally, I love the taste of a little lime juice squeezed over shrimp pad thai before I eat it. And I recall getting it in the past...just not this time. Regarding tail-on shrimp...Okay maybe it's just me. And it's certainly not restricted to my experience with Papaya versus...any Italian place or steak place or anywhere else that they serve shrimp with pasta or my meal. The tails were on. With a dish where you're expected to pick up the shrimp to eat it (friend shrimp\/shrimp cocktail\/grilled shrimp) that makes sense. But in a pasta or noodle dish it means digging into your sauce-covered dish and employing the ""grip-it-and-rip-it"" technique so you get all the meat. Yeah, I guess you could cut it (though my takeout bag did not include a knife) but then you lose some of the tail, which bugs me. And I've heard people say...""it's about presentation...it makes the dish more attractive""....no. No it doesn't. It's the tail of a insectile animal...it does not beautify or enhance the dish. The ray of sunshine is the hot and sour soup, which has been amazing everytime I've had it. I'll go back, but only because it's the closest pad thai in town. And I'm lazy. But not so lazy that I'd leave the tails on my shrimp pad thai.",0,2,0,Negative

I was in the mood for Thai food but mixed it up a bit. The restaurant sits atop ""The Point"" near Robinson Town Center right of 376 in a strip mall. However, I found the inside to have a nice modern, somewhat upscale atmosphere and I couldn't argue with the ""Fine Asian Cuisine"" marketing on the front window. Service was excellent (although it should be considering there were only 3 tables seated as of 730 PM -- that should have set off an alarm). Unfortunately, my accolades stop there. The prices are high compared to competitors like Thai Foon in the nearby Giant Eagle Market District, but I was willing to overlook that for the right food and setting. I started with a classic Wonton soup, but this was anything but classic. They must've forgot the salt, chicken or both in the broth. It was terribly bland with only a subtle hint of cilantro that has no business in any wonton soup variant. Next I had some fried dumplings. While they weren't terrible, they weren't exceptional either. All 5 of them looked nearly identical, giving away that this ""fine dining"" restaurant uses pre-packaged dumplings. A real disappointment. For my entrée I had a Thai classic, Pad See Ew, which is typically a dish comprised of wide noodles, a choice of meat, broccoli, bean sprouts and eggs, in a brown sauce. Papaya's rendition of thin noodles looked more like a Cantonese style lo mein, but hey a noodle is a noodle I suppose. Their offering was with broccoli and carrots (??? bizarre), so I had the chef add bean sprouts and napa cabbage to help it out. Unfortunately, the ""dark sauce"" was nothing more than a half bottle of soy sauce which overpowered the dish to the point of wondering whether I might suffer middle-of-the-night kidney failure. Bottom line, this Pad See Ew had an emphasis on the Ew. My bill of $27.15 for the above and a small white rice (not included with the meal) was, in hindsight, mind boggling for this poor showing of food.

She seemed very offended that I would even ask about the quality of the salads. What she brought me though was a wilted mess slathered in dressing.

Thoroughly average fare, really. The beer is nice, but nothing to get too excited about. Moving on. I ended up here with a party of 12, celebrating a co-worker's impending move to California. I ordered the grilled salmon with polenta, and it was ok. Again, nothing special, until I took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth. Since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy, I did a double take and took the crunchy thing out, rather than swallow it. This turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass. Not only that, but when I cut into the middle of the polenta again (on the grounds of ""this merits further investigation"") I found *another* piece of glass! Right there in the middle! Not huge shards (about the size of my pinky nail) but big enough to cut internally if swallowed. My co-workers and friend that I was with were all witnesses to this. I'll give CBW credit for handling this about the way you're supposed to: as soon as I told the waiter, he told the manager, who came over and was super apologetic. Obviously comped my meal (I got replacement food) and drinks, and offered me dessert to take home. That's great and all, but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food. I can see a completely different scenario where I accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries, or even just cut up my mouth; that story doesn't end happily for anyone involved. Most places you go, you don't expect this to happen. Doubly so for a place that charges $20 a plate. If that's the level of diligence that goes into food preparation at CBW, I don't think I could ever recommend it to anyone.",2,1,0,Negative

Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. Last night, I tried the ""Sizzling Sensation"" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the ""Taro Bowl A-La-King."" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or ""weight watchers"" items. That goes for just about anywhere!

He ignored us for what he thought was long enough for us to make a decision, at which point he came over and asked ""you know what you want?"" But damn, he underestimated the power of this girl's indecision, what a bother. I told him that I was undecided between two different weiss beers they had on draft. He promptly turned around and walked away. During his absence, I decided to just not get a beer, in fact, to spend as little money as possible because this guy had the air of being the owner (who else could get away with being such an asshole), whom I did not want to support. So eventually my partner got his beer (which he could have ordered much earlier if this guy had a molecule of patience) and we ordered one entree, a mushroom sandwich, to share with a salad and also a side order of sweet potato fries. Except for some rotten salad greens, the food was good. This could probably be a three star review if it wasn't for the hostile environment that we experienced. To top it all off, as soon as we got up to leave, he came over to the book to check his tip (guess what, it wasn't very good!) and sarcastically yelled after us, ""thanks A LOT"" followed by some indiscernible muttering.

Isaac Holeva from Faded\/premiere innovations is always raving about it and I'll say I appreciate his enthusiasm about good eats. My fiancé and I went this evening arriving about 15 minutes early for our 6:30 reservations (not needed place only had five tables sat) and were immediately a little put off. There were two girls behind the bar with a deer in headlights look... after a little deliberation between the two one decided she would seat us, but only after going to talk to one of her tables. So we waited awkwardly for several minutes before she came over to seat us. We choose our own table in the dining room, as apparently that was the norm, and aside from one hideous piece of art it was quite nice. High ceilings, murals of fish on the walls and some tables were actually accented with fish bowls. After sitting for ten minutes without so much as a greeting, and without menus I might add(she claimed to have no idea where they were??), a waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered the Rodolfo Malbec ($40) and were finally allowed to see the menu offerings. The malbec was a little on the lighter bodied side for me but tasty nonetheless. The waitress returned with our wine about 12 minutes later and poured both glasses without offering a taste or checking to see if it was even the right bottle. Aside from the obvious time dilemma, this is a clear sign of poor training\/management. Regardless, we ordered. My fiancé selected the lobster bisque to share with me and the shrimp and scallops with the lobster buerr blanc preparation. I chose the land and sea pairing of 6oz filet with three jumbo shrimp and a scallop served with smashed redskin potatos and charred asparagus. Another 10 minutes went by before her soup finally arrived. The bisque appeared a little darker than I am accustomed to seeing them and I immediately suspected the rue was burnt. sure enough there was a bitter tone that muddled the flavor of this bisque which did sport some nice meaty chunks. The food arrived about 15 minutes after the soup and I must say this was the highlight of the evening. Everything was cooked perfectly! The lemongrass on the steak was an excellent preparation and the shrimp and scallops were broiled to perfection. There was an obvious fresh quality to everything and I must note the shrimp especially was a little briney as if fresh out of the ocean. The scallops were the best thing on both of our plates! We devoured everything and decided to stay for an after dinner drink. The cocktail selection offered several delicious sound cocktails and we opted for a lemon basil martini. It sounded so good but after waiting for literally 15 minutes while 3 people sat behind the bar doing nothing we decided to simply leave. Overall I would rate the place 6.75 out of 10. The staff was awful and it seemed people appeared out of nowhere to stand around and do nothing. There was no apparent management figure, although I did see luke himself come to 2 tables to deliver food. They need a serious overall in the GM department.

I started my lunch drive heading in the direction of a seeming recent yelpers' hang, intent upon adding my two cents to the flood of reviews. Lesson one. . . read not only the reviews, but also the hours of operation. Not only was my bride not open for lunch. . . but it was also not open on Tuesdays at ALL. Disappointed, I turned for home, wondering what I'd have for lunch since I'd been focused to the point of excluding any other potential venues from consideration, when I decided on The Flame. I like barbecue, pulled pork, etc, and it sounded good. I've eaten at The Flame (or rather ordered from then taken out) several times, and always enjoyed it, but this was my first visit with an eye toward ""reviewing it"". Unfortunately this was not my best visit. Waitstaff (the lady behind the counter) seemed not to be having a great day. Though she wasn't outright hostile, neither did she make any attempt to welcome me to The Flame, saying simply, ""Did you order for pickup?"" and at my negative response, ""What can I get you?"" I think that, and the amount owed (upon collecting my food to go) was the extent of our dialog. I decided to jump on the Mac 'n' cheese 'n' insert food item bandwagon and ordered the Stock o' Mac with pulled pork, and a side of sweet potato fries. I love me some sweet potato fries. I collected my plastic shopping bag and left the 'welcoming' fires of the barbecue behind. The Stack o' Mac was good. Really good, honestly. Upon initial inspection it looked like nothing so much as a pile of pulled pork on top of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Deluxe despite indications of home made mac'n'cheese. It was sooo much better than Kraft. I guess I'm not sure what I was REALLY expecting from homemade mac and cheese. That it would LOOK like the noodles were homemade? Stupid. It was velvety and sharp and delightful and upon further review, surprised me that the sole criticism of it was that there wasn't more of it, since what I'd really been drawn to was not so much the macaroni, but the pulled pork. The portion size was a tad smaller than I'd have liked. It's not a huge criticism, because I probably don't NEED to be eating more than what was given, and there was a hefty bunch of pulled pork on top of it. . . but I liked it more than I thought I would, and I think it would have balanced out the dish a little if there'd been more of the great mac 'n' cheese. The sweet potato fries were also good, but ""floppier"" than I prefer. I like a nice crisp fry. But these had great skin-on, earthy, sweet flavor, and when I got home and dipped them in a little Sweet Baby Ray's (cause that's how I roll) they were very tasty and I found that relative to the total experience my disappointment with the texture was pretty minor. Cost wise, it's not a bunch to spend. $10.86 for lunch. But this is Millvale. Relative to the surroundings and what the neighboring establishments charge. . . it actually seems sort of spendy. I expect, for example, to drop $15.00 or more for lunch in Pittsburgh on any given day (with tip). But Millvale? There was no tip to worry about, but also no drink. Seemed like a bit much for a bit too little. Overall, I'll definitely be back. I don't think I'd counsel anyone to undertake a journey to visit, but certainly if you're in the area and have a hankerin' for pulled pork or chicken wings, it's a good venue.",1,1,1,Negative

The grilled pineapple was the only flavorful item on the bun, but unfortunately 1\/2 of it was the hard inside core that you can't bite through. The whole wheat bun also started falling apart on my first bite and I didn't know there was banana ketchup on it until I reread the menu description afterward. If I had ordered an actual burger would I feel differently? I tasted my husbands burger and other than the meat itself, it was equally flavorless. He was in total agreement.

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was. Well, that was also the only time I had, as well. I was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee. They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee. I had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes. The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon. I went with the banana oatmeal. Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot. My food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes. I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon. I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs\/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes. The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon. Crispy yet chewy. I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory. Let's talk about the hotcakes. They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved. Whipped butter spreads pretty easy. I like that. I'm picky. Especially with breakfast. There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked. They tasted like a diabetics worst\/best nightmare. They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be. They would have been fine without syrup. When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread. I wanted to stop at one. I really did. I really really did. I was getting full. I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem. I had a problem with that second hotcake My other ""complaint"" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner. I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast. For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least. My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive. So, I will go back, for sure.

Excited at the thought of enjoying semi-authentic Mexican tacos for $5 a pair, I knew I had to come check out this deal. After all, having closed for a few months due to liquor license issues, this place may offer new thrills and flair that didn't exist before. Our group was immediately able to find seats in the outdoor patio, thinking we were lucky that the other people of Lawrenceville were not taking advantage of this deal. We were served by a petite brunette waitress with curly hair wrapped in a bun. She went over the drink special and proceeded to take our drink order, all business without a smile (which is fine). Since we were a large group, we ordered a decent amount, and then each of us ordered 1-2 orders of tacos each, salivating at the thought of $5 tacos. Our tacos eventually came out, which came in pairs and were okay in quality. I'll never complain about $5 tacos though. We eventually got the check but were confused why all of our tacos except for 4 were listed at full price. After notifying the waitress, she gives us an empty stare and then says that only 3 of the listed tacos are $5. Mind you, the menu has no mention of any of their specials and does not explicitly say that only certain tacos are $5 during their Monday special. She then goes to grab the manager (or at least someone who claims he's the manager; he actually bartends at the front bar), who comes to our table and apologizes on the waitress's behalf by saying that the waitress is correct and that she clearly told us about the taco special's specifications. According to him, the only reason why all 7 of us magically did not hear her mention anything about the taco special was because we were all talking when she was going over them. To top it all off, he justified it by saying that she's one of their best servers (love high standards) so he has to go by her word. After all, the customer is always WRONG. Astonished and appalled that the manager was blaming us, we proceeded to insist that the waitress never mentioned anything and that a restaurant menu should have explicit information saying so. He then says that the sign outside the restaurant, which happens to point towards a side street away from the main entrance, clearly states the details of this special. Furthermore, he exclaimed that since they re-opened, they had to cut back on their specials. I'm sorry you guys closed because you failed to renew your liquor license; it was totally our fault.

The nice thing is that they have pictures of almost all their dishes plastered up on the wall if we wanted some visual idea of what we were to order and there's Chinese on their menu too. The owner also speaks both Cantonese and Mandarin. Unfortunately, when we went on a Friday night, the place was horribly understaffed with only one cook (most likely the owner) and one waiter. And since they serve on a table-by-table process, the food for us, a party of 8 took almost an hour to completely arrive. At least we had tea to keep our stomachs from growling too loudly. Once the food arrived, I guess I expected more authentic Chinese cooking. The beef and chicken was steamed and looked like one of the healthy options you would choose off a separate menu. They had a nice variety of Chinese styled vegetables though and a very wide Asian drink selection. My regret is that I should have looked at some of the pictures before ordering because some of the dishes were surprisingly simple. Such as the shrimp & eggs for $10, which was literally a couple of shrimps put inside an egg omelet. I'm not quite sure how authentic that is... The decor was simple. There were just a couple of tables for sit-down eating and only two tables that could accommodate large parties of either 6 or 8. It is also BYOB which I didn't discover until another party brought in a couple bottles of wine. I'm not sure what the corkage fee is though, if there is any.

He moved the family together so they can be seated at 1 table versus being separated, etc. He said a little bit more but I cannot remember exactly verbatim but nonetheless his tone and body language were uncalled for.

This place has got to buy there salt in bulk bc they are heavy handed with the stuff. We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty\/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime. They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it. The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend. I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words. The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious. I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates. The drinks were solid and i would recommend the margarita's. Solid place to have a drink and the decor was also modern and cool. The crowd gave it a good vibe and I could definitely see myself hanging out here if I am in the area again.

He wasn't terribly savvy about the selections, appeared to read them off a slip of paper hidden on his tray (or was chronically fearful of making eye contact), and wasn't terribly informative about some of the items on the menu. That said, the food was excellent. I had the special, which was braised lamb ravioli on pureed white beans with carmelized onions and fig and was such a fantastic marriage of flavors and textures that I felt it trumped the previous two paragraphs worth of whining on my part. My wife ordered her steak rare. . . and let me tell you, the law would forbid a rarer steak from being served without reclassifying the restaurant a butcher shop. . . which is EXACTLY how she likes it.

It used to be served in this cast-iron pie dish. Not anymore. Instead, this gummy, undercooked (COLD) garlic bread arrived at the table. I guess cold is the theme for the meal. The house salad did fine but was sort of not impressive enough to distract from the cold bread. Wine was served. And drank. And drank. Because it took our food FOREVER to come. We ordered the traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 and a large side of pasta (when in Rome). After our meal arrived, we dug in. Turkey Breast (so SO DRY) on top of stuffing (which most folks liked) both were COLD. Mashed potatoes (those were pretty good, but cold.. If they weren't cold, I would have had seconds). Green beans (cold). We told the waitress but she was empathatic. The manager came out and offered to give us more food but because we had waited SO LONG to begin with, we dug in and didn't find it necessary to wait again for more food.

We could see empty tables around and more that were being cleaned so we hoped it wouldn't be long. 8:30pm comes around and we were still waiting. The empty tables we saw were being filled and more people we waiting. I went to the hostess station to ask what the deal was and was told that ""There's 2 parties in front of you.."". Over the course of 30 minutes the only seated one party? Not buying that. My friends and I were hungry so we left. Before I left I chatted with a guy at the bar who was leaving as well - told me he ordered his food and waited 35 minutes but they lost his order and he never got it. I hoped after being open for a month they would work out any kinks they might have. If I would have wandered in at 8pm and had this experience that's one thing - but not taking a reservation and having your patrons waste their time is another. Why not take a reservation, it's guaranteed business? I can't comment on the food, but the decor was cool i guess. I hope other ppl get better customer service than I received.",1,1,0,Negative

However, after multiple bad experiences, I will not be returning. The final straw occured when I recently had dinner here with 3 other adults and one toddler. First, upon overhearing us discussing the menu, the waiter impatiently asked if he was going to be ""dealing with any vegetarians"". We thought he was being rude to be funny, but learned later he was in fact, just rude. We immediately ordered simple appetizers so that my toddler would be occupied- edamame (which they store frozen so they only need to be quickly boiled) and the bacon-wrapped mochi (arguably one of the more popular menu items). We then ordered a bottle of wine. There are only 4 red wines on the menu. When we picked one the waiter said- oh, Ive never had anyone order that before- as if we had made some obscure choice. It was so odd and his tone was so accusatory. It made no sense. We tried to just laugh it off. About 15 min later we ordered our entrees. 10 min later 2 of the 4 entrees arrived, but no sign of the apps. When we inquired, the waiter told us it was because different chefs make different dishes and the chef assigned to the 2 entrees we had received wasn't very busy at the moment so those dishes were finished first. A ridiculous explanation- appetizers are called starters on the menu for a reason- you start with them! Another 10 min went by before the apps arrived. 10 minutes later (1 hour after we sat down) the other 2 entrees showed. 2\/4 adults in our party had long since finished their meals. At this time, my 3 year old asked if she could have some noodles. I asked the waiter if we could have a side dish of noodles (they have sides of rice on the menu). He said he ""wasn't sure"" and he would check. 25 MINUTES WENT BY- and my husband had to get up and go get the waiter to check on the status of the noodles we had ordered. The waiter told us he hadn't had a chance to ask the chef. Now, we are sitting at a table in front of the chefs. I could have asked for them by simply raising my voice! I was floored. I asked to speak with a manager and was told the manager was the chef and was too busy to talk to us. 5 minutes later the waiter returned and said he could not bring a side dish of noodles because the chefs didnt want to ""open another package of noodles"". Outraged, I told him we obviously would be paying for the noodles, there are noodles on the menu- why would he not cook them for us? The waiter had no response except to say the chef said no. As we left, we overheard the same waiter tell a customer that he had lost her reservation and he had no tables for her available. The customer then pointed at our empty table and asked if her party could sit there and the waiter replied, ""yeah, I guess I could set it for you."" Are they TRYING to NOT make money here and drive customers away? It's really unfortunate that this restaurant has such terrible customer service. On past visits I've had to wait 45 min for the check, and had another experience of 1 of 4 entrees arriving 30 min after the others (and not the Okonomiyaki which the menu clearly says takes 25 min to cook- this was a simple noodle small plate that just didnt arrive until everyone else was done eating- no explanation, no apology). I want to like this place- the food is actually really good. But I refuse to pay for such terrible customer service again. I'll opt for noodles from Smiling Banana Leaf, or dine in at E2 or Park Bruges when out in the neighborhood.",8,0,0,Negative

Overall my biggest complaint would be the price of our meal , for the price you pay on an entree it should come with a side and a larger portion.

It consisted of a good variety of fish, including (if I remember correctly) lean tuna, fatty tuna, farmed Atlantic salmon, octopus, snapper. While these pieces of sashimi are not particularly outstanding, they are not too bad for a budget sushi restaurant (unlike the unfresh stuff found in certain other Pittsburgh sushi restaurants).

No patina of cigarette smoke and coffee stains, like the tried and true diners of old. Which is a good thing. The service was good, I don't recall her being particularly knowledgeable, but how knowledgeable could she have been since we ate there two weeks after they opened? I also don't remember her being NOT knowledgeable. So. . . YAY! Now for the bad. . . I ordered a reuben. My friend remarked that it's hard to find a place that has a good reuben. I didn't necessarily agree, but said nothing. We both got it. We were both surprised to see it served open face, which, upon asking the manager (we'll come back to him in a minute) was because, ""It's the chef's interpretation of a reuben. He wanted to make it unique."" It WAS unique. But unique in a way that sucked. Like if the chef interpreted a hot dog by saying, ""HERE we serve our hot dogs with the mustard in your hand instead of on the dog. "" It was a stupid interpretation. Messy. And not good. Because the sauerkraut was kind of slippery, and the cheese was kind of melty, and the dressing was very heavy handed, so when you used your knife to cut it you ended up with half the sandwich still on the plate because it wouldn't stick on the fork, so you had a bite of cheese and dressing, then went back for a bite of bread and saurkraut and meat. It was sloppy and I ended up scooping most of the dressing onto the side of the plate so it was tolerable. And on the plus side there was a lot of food. . . but the negative of that was it was really hard to cut without food dropping off the side of the plate while you sawed at the sandwich through the meat. So then the manager came to our table, which I generally liked, but he was so aggressively wanting to nip any issues in the bud that he came across a little. . . militantly servile. ""Did everything exceed your expectations?"" he asked. Then when our grunts of polite assent didn't suffice, he addressed each of us individually. . . it was uncomfortable. I just wanted to be left to eat my shitty sandwich in peace. I felt uncomfortable complaining about my shitty sandwich, because it was, of course, ON PURPOSE. Did it exceed my expectations? No! But I didn't really want to interrupt my meal to have a discussion about it. I bought his departure by saying that I didn't really have any expectations coming in, so I couldn't really judge whether they'd been exceeded. Which was a lie. When we paid our bill. . . the manager was at the cash register. . . eagerly waiting to ask, once more, ""Did your experience exceed your expectations?"" UGGGGHHHH! I just wanted to leave. ""I don't know, yes. . . yes, it was fine!"" Ultimately, I will return. It was really close to work, and it's my own fault for not reading that they serve the reuben open faced. I assume it's on the menu that way. And next time I'll just tell the manager to go away because he's bothering me, which is more my speed. . . I was just caught a little off guard. If my next experience is. . . better (which will exceed my expectations) I'll update my review and add a star or two to it. Until then though. . . it was ""meh"". Diner food.",5,1,1,Negative

Most recently, we made reservations for New Year's Eve for 3 people for 7PM. We arrived about 10 minutes early and still had to wait till about 7:15 before we were seated. During our wait, we sat at an open table near the bar where we proceeded to order a couple drinks. However, the beers listed on the chalkboard menu on the wall weren't up to date. So the server had to keep running back and forth to the bar to verify the available drafts. We finally got to our table and ordered. Although our food showed up in a timely manner, the ""fresh"" veggies were mush and the food was accompanied by gnats. They were flying all over the place, landing on the table, on the wall, my boyfriend spent half the time swatting them away...but it was tough to gain the attention of our server as she was immersed in what must have been a very interesting conversation with a customer nearby. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager reduced our bill. They couldn't move us due to the fact that all the tables had scheduled reservations. Finally, when we had our food boxed up since we didn't want to eat with the gnats, they boxed up and gave us some of the wrong food....it was just comical at that point.

Even though there were servers in the area and walking past us multiple times, there was not acknowledgment.

I applaud the effort to try something new in Pittsburgh. I understand the concept of the chef incubator. But their claim that you don't need reservations and can easily find a table was not the case on Saturday night. We struggled to find a table for two amid a cacophonous throng. We found ourselves taking off items of apparel just to save a table. The first thing you have to do is find your table. Take off your jacket to save your table, and then step up to the bar to order drinks. You have fight for a place at the bar. You fight for a place at the restaurants. You are spoken to a bit brusquely at the restaurant because they are inundated by orders. This would normally be an activity that would be only witnessed by your server in a traditional restaurant. Then you make your way back to your seat and shoo away people wondering if your table is available. Once your food comes , you wander aimlessly around looking for a clean Fork. The station where in the cutlery and napkins reside is devoid of clean utensils. You can't find a fork. You give up and go to the restaurant and ask someone at the restaurant at which you ordered to find you a fork. Five minutes later, they courteously come with a fork. Sound like a relaxing evening? I sat there and watched women in high heels and evening dress bussing their own tables. To be fair, our food was excellent. We ordered the roasted chicken and the prawns carbonara. I had a lentil salad which was delectable. I have absolutely no argument with the quality of the food. I give the food 4 out of 5 Stars. It was inventive and tasty. It was served in a timely fashion. The beleaguered line cook even brought it out to my table. This brings up another topic. In my past trips to the smallman Galley when purchasing food, there has been a opportunity to tip. It was my belief when I tipped my server that I was tipping for service. Generally, at the Smallman Galley, I am walking up to the register and placing my order. I pay for my order. I go back to my seat. When my order is ready, I get up, get my silverware, and bring the plate back to the table. I am assuming that the payment for the food covers the salary of the employees who work there and that there is no need for tipping. So, in closing, to be fair, you will get an excellent meal. You'll get a very decent drink. But you will pay pretty much what you will pay at a high-end restaurant. For two people with drinks and main course with side, salad, and appetizer we paid about $135 for our evening at Smallman Galley. But I wonder how long it's going to take the throngs of people jamming into the restaurant to figure out that that is what they could pay for an evening out at a nice restaurant and not have to bus their own tables, fight for a spot ordering., look for a fork, fight for a spot at the bar to order a drink, etcetera. Saturday, after a tough work week, should not be a slog and a fight at your favorite restaurant. But all of this is not to say that Smallman Galley does not have its merits. I think the execution just needs some work. If they had servers and Runners and tableside ordering with iPads or other electronic devices, the system would work much better. You wouldn't have to fight for a spot at a restaurant. You wouldn't have to bus your own tables. You wouldn't have to fight for a fork. And the tip that you leave would be truly Justified. This is a good idea. The execution though is horrible and needs work if this business model is to continue. And by the way, don't believe that a seat is a foregone conclusion at this restaurant on a busy night. 4 stars for the food, 0 stars for the experience of dining out to equal an average of 2 Stars.",4,1,1,Negative

When received total bill all drinks were charged at the double shot\/ounce rate of $12. When I asked why, the waitress explained that because the drinks were on the rocks that they had to make it a double. When I explained that I never ordered ice, and that this should've been explained, as the menu makes no reference to the price being based on ice with the drink or not, she agreed that she should've explained when I ordered and offered to have a manager speak with me. The manager explained that the price I was charged was not based on the ice but instead that I did not order a mixer with the drink. He explained that if you order a drink straight you have to get a double. If order a drink with a mixer you have to get a single shot. When I asked him to explain why that is not specified on the menu he agreed that it should be. When I asked if it's not then why aren't servers mandated to explain to customers he acknowledged that they should. At this point I asked if I could be charged the lesser rate for each drink and he stated no. When I explained that their charges on my bill were deceptive and unfair he simply informed me that nothing could be done. I also explained that I ordered the same drink on a previous visit and was charged the single shot rate. He stated he could not change the bill. I had not yet started to drink my last drink so I then asked if he could take it back as I was unwilling to pay for it. He informed me that he could not because it was already poured and now contaminated and they could do nothing with it. At this point I told him that he either had to remove my last drink that I had not started to drink or call the police as I was not going to pay any portion of the bill unless it was removed. He agreed to remove it. I paid the double ounce price for all other drinks even though when I ordered that is not what I ordered.

No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. Also, their bar seating sucks.

This last visit to the restaurant, I learned something very important and that is when you see a not-so-recently deceased clown fish on the bench in front of the aquarium where you would presumably wait to be seated or sit to view the otherwise lively aquatic environment, laugh and exit the establishment immediately. Don't sit there and continue to order a feast, no, don't. I, stupidly, was able to stop peering at and laughing about the highly visible dried up and flat dead clown fish for long enough to order way too much food. Our server was new and did not know Indian food, at all. We had to slowly repeat and point to what we wanted; neither English nor any of the many Indian languages were her first language, poor girl - she probably knew about the fish - we imagined her internal struggle over what to do about it...it being her first day and all, worrying about whether she should tell anybody for fear she will be blamed or yelled at or forced to touch it, or maybe she should just pick it up already and get it out of sight, but then what if somebody sees her and attention is brought to the fact that there is indeed a dead fish and that a person who is also handling food is handling a rotting fish... Sooo, enough with Finding Nemo and on to the deplorable food. We ordered vegetable samosas as our appetizer. They were flatter and smaller than the typical samosa, scantily spiced, and they seemed to have been frozen and microwaved (hardly) rather than deep fried. They were cold. Not greasy (like I think they should be). The chutneys and mango pickle all had the quality of having been born in a factory, canned, shelved for years, opened last week and sitting out all day before being served to us. I didn't try the papadam because I could tell that that too was cheaply manufactured. For entrees, the two of us shared Baingan Bharta, Aloo Gobi and a Dosa. The Dosa was ice cold, pale white and, well, I never knew they could be frozen without breaking. The sambar that came with it tasted like Campbell's Tomato Soup. The aloo (potatoes) in the aloo gobi tasted as if from a can (can you sense a trend yet?), there wasn't much gobi (cauliflower) and the dish lacked spice and complexity. Although the texture was ok, he flavor of the Baingan Bharta was completely overwhelmed with mustard (I realized that I had noticed this with my previous take out\/delivery too - so I think it's the recipe, not a fluke). The rice was basic fluffy white rice, with literally a few cumin seeds in it but nothing else of note. Nothing was garnished with cilantro\/coriander leaves, no cardamom pods were found. The naan was the worst I've ever had, and like many components of the meal, contained the essence of the package it emerged from, kinda like frozen pizza dough, nothing much like fluffy, bubbly homemade naan, ok, the shape was about right, albeit too perfect. It also had regular butter (which I dislike and do not eat) on it instead of ghee (which I will tolerate). They were somehow out of garlic naan (Giant Eagle must have been out. of. garlic. naan).

Where do I begin? The chips and salsa came out quickly and the chips were good but could have been out of a bag. The salsa was awful. It had so much oregano in it that it was like dipping in spaghetti sauce instead of salsa. There was no cilantro present, it was like they used oregano instead of cilantro. Luckily we didn't have much time to eat the chips and salsa as our food somehow miraculously came out literally five minutes after we ordered it. This seems like an impossibility to me unless of course it was already prepared and sitting in a bin under a heat lamp or in a chaffing dish in the kitchen, which is where I'm putting my money. My chimichanga was somewhere in size between a large sharpie magic marker and a cardboard paper towel tube. It was not fried like a chimichanga is supposed to be. The rice, refried beans and chimichanga were all completely bland and flavorless. How do you even get bland and flavorless food to happen in a Mexican restaurant? I was still hungry when I left it was so small. My spouse's arroz con pollo is supposed to be made with thigh and leg meat over rice. His dish was made with tiny chopped up chunks of breast meat instead and also lacked any flavor or spice. We had to get up and again hunt someone down to get our drinks refilled.

And about the check - at $15(!) for the benedict and $11 for pancakes, it was noticeably more expensive than other comparable restaurants. In summary, I think Bizarre Marco is tragically hip.

If you're the kind of person who has never experienced ramen except for cheap instant noodles in college, then... surprise, surprise! the $12 offering at Ramen Bar is far superior to a disposable $0.50 meal. But, if you have ever been to Japan, or to any large American or Canadian city that has real ramen, then you will immediately realize that what the Ramen Bar serves up is only a poor imitation at best. I tried the shoyu chashu ramen, a classic dish that earned the Tsuta ramen shop in Tokyo a Michelin Star. At the Ramen Bar, the shoyu broth had none of the delicate balance of saltiness and umami that one would expect, but instead tasted just like any $1 shoyu-flavoured instant noodle seasoning, except strongly diluted with water so that it was even worse. Instead of richly marbled chashu that's sliced to 0.5 mm thick and melts in your mouth, they give you... stringy pork monoliths that are rock hard, tasteless, and take away all the moisture in your mouth so as to scrub against your tongue like sandpaper. Well, at least they give you quite a large quantity of meat, so they've got that going for them. The server was quite nice too. It is deplorable indeed that many Pittsburghers will never get to try the real delicacy that is ramen.",3,0,0,Negative

You could charge a minimum instead at least , like $10 to use card or something. I rarely carry cash so it wasn't ideal for me. So many boba places in LA take card payment for milk tea so maybe it's a different approach on the east coast here. Idk. Expectations shattered. The drinks are a small selection of flavors. But I did come across some flavors I don't normally see. Caramel milk tea caught my eye. The drinks are good but I think I'm just too spoilt from all the high competition in LA, that this place is hard to judge from my previous experiences at other tea shops.

So in effect I'm rating them not on an absolute scale but relative to what they try to be. I'll say right off the bat that I was very underwhelmed by Avenue B. It was hyped to me by some friends and the fact that it was a pain to get a reservation for this place for a Friday night made me think that it was worth the hype. Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. I came here with my girlfriend, and as appetizers we got the tartare and the mussels. The tartare was perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole meal: entirely bland with almost no dressing. There was a sort of slight smoky flavor to the meat tartare (there was also a salmon tartare as well) but otherwise it was pretty tasteless (the salmon wasn't any better). The mussels were very small, though the sauce was pretty decent. I found it mostly unexceptional, though my girlfriend liked it, but for the same price you can get a much better dish at either Point Brugge or Brasserie 33. For the mains I had the hanger steak and she had the monkfish. I am not terribly familiar with monkfish so I don't know what the ""right"" way to prepare it is, but when I tried a piece, it was rather flavorless. My girlfriend thought that it was tougher than it should have been and that the taste of the fish was watered down by the sauce. It seems to me that when you have a fish that is not naturally full of flavor, you have to prepare a sauce for it that enhances it, but it didn't seem to me like that was the case with that dish. The hanger steak was fine, and the lobster mac and cheese was a nice touch, but again, there wasn't anything particularly special about it. The meat was of decent quality and prepared nicely, but overall I found it less juicy and flavorful than the hanger steaks I had at Salt and Meat & Potatoes. We also had a side dish of brussels sprouts to share, which I thought were ok, if a little too well done and too drenched with sauce. The only really good part of the meal was the dessert. We split the chocolate salt bar with the olive oil ice cream, which was very nice. Overall, we both felt that Avenue B was overrated relative to other good restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's not that anything was bad per se, but if you're interested in getting a good meal in the 412, there are any number of restaurants that you could go to that would cost you the same amount but have much better quality of food. Just to list a few: Salt, Meat & Potatoes, and Legume, all of which have a comparable style of food, are much better and not more expensive. In addition, all those places have great cocktails, whereas Avenue B is BYOB; nothing wrong with that, but it's not like I'm going to be mixing a bourbon drink at my table.

The chips and salsa were the one exception: as good as everyone says they are. But the rest of it, I found to be really kind of lacking. The ceviche had these tiny, tiny shrimp that just absolutely had no taste to them, for example. I don't get it; serve me some actual crustaceans and charge me more.

Primanti Brothers is open 24 hours a day and has a small parking lot attached for customer parking. If you get there after 6pm street parking is open, so you should have several options. The restaurant is a lot of fun to look at. You can tell it has been around for a long time (80 years). The walls are covered in framed newspaper articles reviewing the restaurant, pictures of celebrities at the restaurant, and t-shirts that say ""Bite Me...Primanti Brothers."" They are a cash only facility, but there is an ATM in the front in case you don't have any cash on you. The kitchen is open and you can sit in that room or the attached room where the bar is located. The restaurant can be compared to an old diner or sandwich shop where you can find the menu on a placard on the wall. All but three of the sandwiches are meat heavy. If you are not a meat eater then you may choose one of two fish sandwiches, an egg sandwich, or a cheese sandwich. All sandwiches come with a heaping helping of fries, cole slaw, and tomato piled on top of your sandwich filling choice, and stuffed in between two thick pieces of white bread. I split a cheese deluxe sandwich with my girlfriend. She really enjoyed her half of the sandwich, complimenting the cook for getting the greasiness of the fries just perfect. I was not as pleased with my half. I enjoyed the cole slaw, it added a bit of tang and tart crispness to a rather dull sandwich. They were not at all generous with the amount of cheese in the sandwich, the bread was quite tasteless, and the fries were soggy and flavorless. I added some salt to the fries and that made a world of difference, but I still wasn't a fan. I'm glad I went to the restaurant and experienced this Pittsburgh staple but I could have skipped it and that would have been fine too.

I miss you! As for their sandwiches, I liked the fries and coleslaw combination. Hot salty fries with cool vinegary coleslaw. Yum. However, given the ratio of fries (huge) compared to coleslaw and sandwich filling (pastrami & cheese w\/ egg), sometimes it just tasted like a bland french fry sandwich. When the combination in my bite was just right, it was fabulous, but they could work a little more on the ratios so it's not quite so potatoey. Prob wouldn't be such a big deal if the potatoes weren't a little bland (yes, there are tasty potatoes but not in the 20 lb costco bags). Def the hot sauce at the table helped a lot with the potatoes. It's also a very messy sandwich. Prob due to the cheap white bread.

The bar top was dirty, with a wet menu and the ticket from a previous guest at our seats. There were two bartenders, a male and a female, arguing over something. No one greeted us.

While the food was great the service, the logistics of our seating and table was despicable even with our early planning and reservation. My grandmother and grandfather live in Pittsburg and were looking for a good location to accommodate 30+ family members for thanksgiving dinner. We have enjoyed dinners at McCormick & Schmick's before and it seemed like a perfect choice with their thanksgiving dinner option. My grandparents went to get lunch and discuss reservations options for a group of our size months before thanksgiving (in September). Upon making the reservation they were guaranteed three large tables next to each other. We were cautioned to have our group arrive on time, so we could all be seated, but besides that they guaranteed they could accommodate us and make our holiday wonderful. As planned our large group arrived early or on time. Upon arrival we were told to gather at the bar as they readied our table. After 30 minutes (after our set reservation time passed) of waiting at the bar our group was over pouring onto tables around us, but we were finally seated. We were sat at two tables near each other and one table separated. It was as though they had not planned for our reservation or arrival at all. The table in between ours was an 80th birthday party. The group was clearly not in a rush, and I have no idea why the hostess anticipated they would be leaving quickly or on time for us. Since I have been a hostess at a large chain restaurant I know the intricacies involved with these reservations. Large parties especially special events should always be blocked for longer time and not dependent upon each other leaving. When we addressed the manager with out unhappiness in our reservation she was flippant and annoyed. She simply said, well I am sorry the other party is still not done eating. This should never have been a problem in the first place. Thanksgiving is a very important night for restaurants and we were appalled that extra time and thought was not given to the seating arrangement. The manager and hostess not only made us wait a ridiculous amount of time for our reservation but sat our party separately. The meal was good as expected, but the reservation, wait and attitude of the manager on duty put a bad taste in our mouths for the rest of the night. We will not be eating there again and I caution any other large group or special occasion to think twice before making a reservation. A side note- I am mentioning last because I do not think this is necessary but should be noted- the manager did nothing to compensate us for the aggregation that we were caused financially or in specials or sides. Our family would still have been separated on thanksgiving, but we would at least have felt the manager cared about our situation.

Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear\/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it.

I've had the lunch buffet a couple of times (seemed like the same lame stuff both times) and have ordered dinner from the menu on several occasions. Nothing has ever seemed very fresh and I've not experienced any serious spice here. The tamarind sauce (which you'd think would be their specialty), in addition to all of their condiments, taste generic rather than scratch-made. The dinner entrees come with a side of veggies or dal, and I swear they just give you leftovers from the lunch buffet. For example, I got a side consisting of crusty looking peas and carrots with random stuff dropped in; a lentil and a piece of cauliflower stalk. The rice also seemed reminiscent of buffet recycling measures. I hate to think of food getting wasted, but I'd go dumpster diving before paying $11 for food that most restaurants would either throw away for fear of contamination, or at least freshen up to make their parsimony less obvious. My Baingan Bhartha, a totally mild ""10,"" was tasty enough, however it didn't have any peas in it (it's supposed to, even according to their menu). Best bet is probably to order dosas, because at least you can count on them being made to order.

We made an 8:30 reservation for a party of 7. When the reservation was made we were not told that they closed at 9pm. In my experience when a restaurant closes at a certain time such as 9 that means they stop seating guest at that time but they continue to serve the guest that have been sat. Not at this restaurant. Nothing was said to us as about the closing time as we ordered two nice bottles of wine and a seafood appetizer but as we were eating the appetizer our waiter came to the table and said that the restaurant closes at 9 and that they send the bartended home at 9:15 so it was last call. We asked to speak to the manager because we had not even ordered dinner yet and felt like we should be able to continue to order drinks with our meal. While waiting for the manager the chef walked over to our table and asked if we were going to be ordering dinner because he had ""payroll in the kitchen that he was running up"". This is a 2 hour type restaurant so it is completely unreasonable for them to seat a party at 8:30 and expect them to be gone by 9 or even to necessarily have ordered by 9. When the manager came over he offered no apology or resolution other than to go ahead and order any drinks we would like before the bartender left. This was unacceptable and as he walked away he was laughing and joking with the chef about it. At this point we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left. This is not the way a nice restaurant should treat their guest. The one high point was our waiter. He was obviously embarrassed by the way the management handled the situation. He was very apologetic and could not have been nicer even though he was losing out on at least a $300 tip. On there website they state ""Ditka's Hospitality is what makes Ditka's a special place.

Went here a little while back with a friend visiting from out of town. Our overall impression? Non-memorable food, and mildly tacky decor led to a ""meh"" type experience. We started with the chips and mango salsa. This was pretty good; their chips are made in-house and were tasty. My friend enjoyed the salsa more than I did, which could be because I didn't expect the mango-tomatillo to be quite so sweet. Could definitely appreciate their fresh ingredients. Sangria was super-sour. To mitigate this, our server suggested simple syrup, and brought some for us to mix in as we saw fit. Take this as you may. On to entrees: Friend got the jerk pulled pork quesadilla which was soggy and over-stuffed with pork (i.e. the cheese-to-pork ratio was definitely off). Although she consumed far less than half of it, she had no desire to pack the rest, and left it to soak in its own juices a bit further. I ordered the chicken breast with confit enchiladas. While the chicken was good, it wasn't anything I'd make a special trip for again. The confit enchiladas, however, were memorable - in a bad way. They were over-cooked, tasting like re-microwaved taquitos. Not even taquitos that were good to begin with, prior to the round 2 reheating. Yikes.

The veg item on the menu the night of our visit was an egg and corn based crepe filled with ricotta and some greens. Two from our party ordered that and their reaction was like, ""eh, it's ok."" Since nothing on the menu was vegan and my advance notice was ignored (as usual), I had to ask if they could make me something special. I also ordered a salad, omitting the cheese that was intended to be in it. The salad was roasted red peppers, tomatoes and greens (it was supposed to also have pea shoots, but they forgot to put them on mine); fresh, but nothing extraordinary. My ""special"" dish was a small portion of pasta (undercooked) with the same roasted red peppers, tomatoes and greens; no sauce, no herbs - very plain, and hey, way too reminiscent of the salad I had JUST hardly enjoyed. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of innovation here. To make matters worse, I very slowly chewed on my extra chewy pasta hoping that our server would come by so that I could send my meal back, but he never came to check on us, so I kept on chewin' until it became apparent to us that we were running late to the theater and to him that it was time for our check.",6,3,0,Negative

If so, its a shame because you would think the restaurant would want to feature their bests. We both ordered the Morton salad with egg, anchovies, and blue cheese and we both agreed that the salads had too much dressing. For the main course, he ordered the 16 once bone in pork chop and I ordered the 6 ounce filet. He definitely went with the better option. The pork was flavorful and delicious. The filet was undercooked, I ordered it medium and it was medium rare. Good flavor, but honestly not better than any filet I've prepared at home. The sides left much to be desired. I ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes. We had to send the potatoes back because they were cold. The broccoli and the potatoes were very bland not much flavor at all, and there was certainly a lack of presentation. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse and he had the key lime pie. The pie was probably the best thing about the whole experience, that and the onion bread. In hindsight, I'm glad we didn't pay full price and I'd much rather have eaten at Ruth Chris or any of the other restaurants participating in restaurant week.

For the most part, we had a lovely time, enjoyed a nice atmosphere with good food and drink and decent service and it was the right venue for hosting all the friends we've made over the last 9 years. But I feel compelled to add that the end of the evening was unpleasant. I should preface this by saying that my boyfriend and I and most of the friends who were there with us met or currently work in food service and are respectful and understanding of business hours and closing procedures at other establishments. We knew ahead of time that the place closed at 1am, and we had every intention of being ready to go at 1am. But starting at midnight, the wait staff started taking drinks away left and right, rabidly clearing our tables if we dared to look away or visit an adjacent table. Then at 12:30, I was told I had missed last call and I couldn't get another drink. Fine -- I didn't need one anyway, but keep in mind my last one had been taken by an overzealous busser while I was hugging someone goodbye. At 12:45, we were reminded that we had 10 minutes left to finish our drinks. ""Great, thanks!"" we said, planning to comply. At 12:50, a wall of security guards more or less stood around us, and they brought a police officer over to cross his arms and pretty much just scowl and stare intimidatingly at us as we tried to say our last goodbyes to good friends, which, to say the very least, put a damper on the festivities. I got the sense they were looking for any excuse to kick us out. If you advertise your hours as being 11:00 am - 1:00 am on a Thursday night, then I think it's only fair to allow your customers to enjoy themselves until the announced closing time. Don't strong arm your customers into leaving before then. We weren't being drunk jerks, we weren't trying to order a lot of food or shots or anything, we were just trying to finish our drinks and say our goodbyes, but the waitstaff and security team just surrounded us with death stares for the last 20 minutes of the night. Had it been 1:15, I'd have completely understood and would have rounded up any oblivious revelers as quickly as possible as part of a cooperative and sympathetic effort, but that was not the case. If not for that, I'd have given them a 5-star rating, but ""last"" impressions matter, too.",0,0,0,Negative

It wasn't that I was against going there, per say, but my absolute hatred of the South Side Works and what is offered there--both establishments and personalities--made me think I would loath it just because of its location. But my affinity for beer, especially beer in giant glass mugs, and the fact that it was the location of one of my good friends 25th birthday party celebration finally brought me in. I arrived sometime around 11 on a Friday night to a line circling around the side of the building. At once I thought my fears were confirmed, a long line of what I perceived to be South Side douche bags. But as I got closer I realized that it wasn't just a bunch of frat boys in line, but there were people of all ages and all walks of life waiting to get in. On top of that the line moved very quickly and all in all only spent about five minutes waiting to get inside. Once inside I made my way to the bar area, which was much more spacious than I thought it would be. That being said, Hofbrauhaus was still extremely crowded leaving little room to stand without bumping in to someone or having someone bump in to you. The dense crowd also left long waits for beer. The bartending staff tried their best to keep up, but there is only so much they can do when you have hundreds of people making human sardines around the bar all trying to order a beer at the same time. I ordered a liter of Dunkel, and when it was finally served to me, tasted pretty good. I'm not all that familiar with German style beers so I'm in no position to comment on its quality, but from an amateur perspective I thought it possessed a strong and unique flavor. The price for a liter wasn't bad, especially considering the location of Hofbrauhaus. I believe the ""big mug"" ran somewhere between $7 and $8. I wish I would have had more time to try a few of the other brews but I didn't get the chance. The atmosphere of Hofbrauhaus is a bit more rowdy than I expected. Long rows of thick wooden tables and benches line the open space between the bar and the stage which aren't used for sitting but instead standing upon. From this perch one feels like he or she is the life of the party singing songs and swinging mugs about, beer sloshing out like a geyser. The band was lively, fun, dressed in authentic Bavarian dress, and I could tell they really did have a passion for the music they were playing, but I was really hoping for something a big more authentic. Most of the songs they played were American covers, nothing but a few songs were German. My experience at Hofbrauhaus was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. It wasn't as much of a corporate juggernaut bar like many of the other bars in the South Side Works area, even though the amount of people they allow to be packed in at once makes you wonder if they care more about their profits or the experiences of their patrons. Will I come back? Probably yes, but only from time to time. I much prefer smaller less crowded and noisy bars, but if I have to pick a larger venue bar Hofbrauhaus would be the place.",0,0,0,Negative

Peter's Pub located at 116 Oakland Avenue has been a long time favorite of Panther frats and sororities. Like many bars in Oakland the downstairs drinking area is a bit cramped, but unlike many of the other Oakland bars Peter's Pub has a spacious upstairs area with another bar and a stage for live music. The beer selection here isn't all that great, most patrons usually have a miller or bud lite bottle in hand. I, being a fan of higher quality draft beer was disappointed to see not too much of a draft selection. I was even more irked at the prices; Peter's Pub is one of the more expensive bars in Oakland. Peter's has a number of gimmick nights to draw in customers. Country night seems to be a favorite, but since I'm not much of a country fan it didn't really thrill me. Anyways, what the music industry seems to market as country these days sounds a lot more of pop rock with a banjo. Though the live entertainment on certain nights includes many local live bands, Peter's Pub usually charges a cover. The cover is all that expensive, but it's just the fact that other bars in Oakland tend to not ask for a cover charge which annoys me. In many ways it seems like Peter's Pub has seemed to confuse itself with a type of bar that is usually found in the South Side. I have no problem with South Side bars, many of them are great places, but it's more of the fact that Peter's Pub just doesn't fit into the neighborhood of Oakland.

So we both purchased the banana choc chip ones listed at $8.50, naturally under the impression that with the coupon we would only pay $2. Long story short, for something I expected to spend less than $5 on, I spent $10.15 + $2 tip. Even if I didn't have the coupon I would've spent less because I wouldn't have bought a drink.

Oh, I almost forgot. . . the wings are good too.",1,1,2,Negative

My big complaint was about the waitress. She was not very accommodating and even told us we lost our table before our reservation time! How does that make any sense?! The food was also just normal bar food. Nothing special. The only good thing about this bar is the rooftop.,0,0,0,Negative
